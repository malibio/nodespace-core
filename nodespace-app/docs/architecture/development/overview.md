# Development Overview

NodeSpace development follows modern patterns with sophisticated keyboard handling, reactive state management, and comprehensive testing.

## Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Text Editor

- **Smart Text Splitting**: Format-preserving content division on Enter key
- **Intelligent Cursor Positioning**: Optimal placement after inherited syntax
- **Dual Representation**: Markdown source â†” AST â†” Display HTML

### Sophisticated Keyboard Handling

- **Hierarchical Awareness**: Different rules for parent/child node interactions
- **Collapsed State Intelligence**: Children transfer rules based on expand/collapse state
- **Format Inheritance**: Smart format precedence on backspace operations

### Reactive State Management

- **Svelte 5 Runes**: Modern reactivity with $state(), $effect(), $derived()
- **Synchronization**: Dual state tracking with consistent UI updates
- **Performance**: Optimized reactivity triggers and state synchronization

## Architecture Highlights

### Component Architecture

```
BaseNodeViewer (UI Coordination)
â”œâ”€â”€ TextNode (Content Management)
â”œâ”€â”€ BaseNode (Core Rendering)
â””â”€â”€ ContentEditableController (DOM Interaction)
```

### State Management

```
ReactiveNodeManager (Svelte 5 Reactivity)
â”œâ”€â”€ NodeManager (Core Logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ ContentProcessor (Dual Representation)
â””â”€â”€ State Synchronization Layer
```

### Key Patterns

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Pure logic in managers, reactive wrappers for UI
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Clean communication between components
3. **Performance First**: Minimal DOM manipulation, efficient state updates
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict configuration

## Development Process

### Standards

- **No lint suppression** - Fix issues properly, don't suppress warnings
- **Bun only** - Package manager enforcement with preinstall hooks
- **Comprehensive testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, manual validation

### Quality Gates

- Build success required
- Linting passes without warnings
- Type checking completes successfully
- Manual testing for complex interactions

## Implementation Notes

### Recent Enhancements

#### Sophisticated Keyboard Rules Migration

- Migrated complex keyboard handling from `nodespace-core-ui`
- Implements depth-aware children transfer logic
- Smart format inheritance on backspace operations
- Collapsed state awareness throughout

#### Smart Text Processing

- Format-preserving content splitting
- Header syntax inheritance on Enter
- Inline formatting preservation during splits
- Optimal cursor positioning algorithms

#### State Synchronization

- Dual collapsed state tracking (Set + property)
- Reactive updates for complex state changes
- Auto-expansion logic for hierarchy operations
- Performance-optimized reactivity triggers

### Key Decisions

1. **UI-First Development**: Build interfaces before backend integration
2. **Mock-Based Independence**: Features work independently with temporary data
3. **Vertical Slicing**: Complete features end-to-end rather than horizontal layers
4. **Forward-Facing Fixes**: Root cause solutions rather than temporary workarounds

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Focus

- **Keyboard interactions**: Complex Enter/Backspace scenarios
- **Hierarchy operations**: Parent/child relationships and collapsed states
- **Format preservation**: Markdown syntax handling during operations
- **State synchronization**: UI consistency during complex state changes

### Automated Testing

- Unit tests for core logic (NodeManager, ContentProcessor)
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance benchmarks for large document operations
- Regression tests for critical keyboard behaviors

## Future Considerations

### Performance Optimizations

- Large document handling strategies
- Memory management for complex hierarchies
- Efficient tree traversal algorithms
- Reactive state optimization

### User Experience Enhancements

- Animation support for hierarchy changes
- Accessibility improvements for complex interactions
- Customizable keyboard behavior preferences
- Advanced undo/redo for sophisticated operations
