# ADR-003: Text Editor Architecture Refactor

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Approved  
**Participants**: Development Team, Senior Architect, Frontend Expert

## Context

Our current text editor architecture has fundamental issues that prevent reliable functionality and limit scalability:

### Technical Problems Identified
1. **Reactivity Anti-Patterns**: Direct prop mutation in Svelte 5 components breaking parent-child binding
2. **Mixed Responsibilities**: Components handling both UI logic and business logic
3. **Performance Issues**: Deep tree traversal on every update, no virtualization
4. **Maintenance Challenges**: Scattered logic across multiple components
5. **Extension Limitations**: Difficult to add AI integration, collaborative editing, or plugins

### Specific Bugs
- **Backspace Node Combination**: Nodes disappear instead of combining content
- **Content Updates**: UI not reflecting data model changes
- **Memory Leaks**: Improper event cleanup in complex component trees

### Expert Analysis
- **Frontend Expert**: Identified Svelte 5 reactivity violations as root cause
- **Senior Architect**: Confirmed need for service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Decision

We will implement a **comprehensive architecture refactor** based on Clean Architecture principles:

### New Architecture Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                Services                 │
│  - ContentProcessor                     │
│  - NodeManager                         │
│  - EventBus                            │
│  - AIService (future)                  │

│  - selectionStore                      │
│  - Derived reactive state              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↕ Props/Events
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              UI Components              │
│  - Pure UI logic only                  │
│  - Single responsibilities             │
│  - Event-driven communication          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Services handle business logic
   - Stores manage state
   - Components handle UI only

2. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - Replace prop drilling with event bus
   - Decouple components from services
   - Enable plugin architecture

3. **Reactive State Management**
   - Centralized stores with Svelte 5 `$state`
   - Derived computed state
   - Proper reactivity patterns

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Virtual scrolling for large documents
   - Debounced content processing
   - Memory leak prevention

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Service Extraction (2 weeks)
- **ContentProcessor**: Extract markdown/HTML conversion logic
- **NodeManager**: Centralize node operations (fixes backspace bug)
- **EventBus**: Implement type-safe event system

### Phase 2: State Management (2 weeks)
- **Document Store**: Centralized document state
- **Selection Store**: Cursor and selection management
- **Derived Stores**: Computed state (visible nodes, etc.)

### Phase 3: Component Refactor (2 weeks)
- **Pure UI Components**: Remove business logic
- **Container Components**: Connect services to UI
- **Event Integration**: Replace prop mutations with events

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (1 week)
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large documents
- **Content Debouncing**: Optimize processing
- **Memory Management**: Prevent leaks

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Fixes Current Bugs**: Solves backspace combination and reactivity issues
- ✅ **Improves Performance**: Virtual scrolling, optimized processing
- ✅ **Enables Extensions**: Clear extension points for AI, collaboration
- ✅ **Better Testing**: Pure functions and services easier to test
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Clear responsibilities, less complexity

### Negative
- ❌ **Development Time**: 7 weeks of refactor work
- ❌ **Migration Risk**: Potential for introducing new bugs
- ❌ **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand new architecture

### Migration Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Incremental migration with feature flags
- **Risk**: Performance regression during transition
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark each phase

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Quick Fixes Only
**Rejected**: Would not solve underlying architectural problems

### 2. Gradual Component Updates
**Rejected**: Mixed architecture would persist, maintenance burden continues

### 3. Complete Rewrite
**Rejected**: Too risky, would lose existing functionality

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] Zero reactivity bugs in text editing
- [ ] Backspace node combination works reliably
- [ ] 1000+ node documents load in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Keystroke latency < 16ms (60fps)
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB for large documents

### Architectural
- [ ] Clear separation between services, stores, and UI
- [ ] 100% test coverage for core services
- [ ] Easy to add new node types and features
- [ ] Plugin system architectural foundation

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Comprehensive TypeScript types
