## New Documentation Structure

The previous single 760-line document has been broken down into focused, navigable sections:

### 🚀 Start Here
- **[Development Overview](overview.md)** - Main hub with navigation to all development docs

### 📂 Process Documents  
- **[Startup Sequence](process/startup-sequence.md)** - Mandatory pre-implementation steps
- **[Issue Workflow](process/issue-workflow.md)** - Complete workflow from issue to PR merge
- **[PR Review Guidelines](process/pr-review.md)** - Code review process and standards
- **[Branching Strategy](process/branching-strategy.md)** - Git workflow patterns

### 📋 Standards & Quality
- **[Code Quality](standards/code-quality.md)** - Linting policy, quality gates, zero-tolerance standards
- **[Testing Guidelines](standards/testing.md)** - Testing requirements and strategies  
- **[Package Management](standards/package-management.md)** - Bun enforcement and dependencies

### 🏗️ Development Patterns
- **[Self-Contained Features](patterns/self-contained-features.md)** - Independent feature implementation
- **[Mock-First Development](patterns/mock-first-development.md)** - Parallel development strategies
- **[Vertical Slicing](patterns/vertical-slicing.md)** - Full-stack feature development

### 🛠️ Reference Guides
- **[Quick Reference](guides/quick-reference.md)** - Commands, checklists, common operations
- **[Troubleshooting](guides/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions

## Quick Access

**Most Common Needs:**
- **Starting new work?** → [Startup Sequence](process/startup-sequence.md)
- **Creating a PR?** → [Quick Reference](guides/quick-reference.md)  
- **Reviewing code?** → [PR Review Guidelines](process/pr-review.md)
- **Quality issues?** → [Code Quality Standards](standards/code-quality.md)

**Updated**: The new structure provides better navigation, focused content, and easier maintenance while preserving all original requirements and standards.
