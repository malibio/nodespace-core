# Mandatory Startup Sequence

> ## üö® **CRITICAL - READ FIRST**
> 
> **This applies to ALL team members**: AI agents, human engineers, and architects.
> 
> **EVERY TEAM MEMBER MUST COMPLETE THIS SEQUENCE BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION WORK**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY STARTUP SEQUENCE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION WORK - COMPLETE THIS EXACT SEQUENCE:**

### 1. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```
- Commit any pending changes first
- Ensure clean working directory

### 2. Determine Branching Strategy
- **REQUIRED**: Read [Epic and Sub-Issue Workflow Guide](epic-and-subissue-workflow.md) for comprehensive guidance
- Identify issue type: Epic, Sub-Issue, or Standalone
- Apply correct branching strategy based on issue type
- **For Sub-Issues**: Always use parent epic branch (never create separate branch)

### 3. Create/Switch to Branch
Based on strategy determined in step 2:

**Individual Branch Approach:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/issue-<number>-brief-description
```

**Parent Issue Branch Approach:**
```bash
git checkout feature/issue-<parent-number>-name
```

### 4. Assign Issue
```bash
bun run gh:assign <number> "@me"
```

### 5. Update Project Status - Use Bun API Commands
**Use TypeScript GitHub API commands (no Claude Code approval prompts):**

```bash
# Update status: Todo ‚Üí In Progress
bun run gh:status <number> "In Progress"
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No approval prompts** - Pure TypeScript API calls
- ‚úÖ **Precise and reliable** - Direct GitHub API integration
- ‚úÖ **Simple syntax** - Easy to remember and use
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - Clear success/failure messages

**üìñ See [Issue Workflow](issue-workflow.md) for complete CLI command reference**

### 5.1 Parent Issue Status (Single-Branch Strategy)
**If working on sub-issues with single-branch approach:**
- Update BOTH parent and sub-issue to "In Progress"  
- Assign BOTH issues to yourself
- Example: Issue #26 (parent) + Issue #46 (sub-issue)

```bash
# Update parent issue status
bun run gh:status <parent-number> "In Progress"

# Assign parent issue
bun run gh:assign <parent-number> "@me"
```

### 6. Select Appropriate Agent/Expert - MANDATORY
**üö® YOU MUST USE SPECIALIZED AGENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:**

This step is NOT optional. You MUST delegate to specialized agents using the Task tool:

**Decision Tree:**
1. **Is this about visual design, UI patterns, or design systems?** ‚Üí Use `ux-design-expert`
2. **Is this about frontend components, Svelte, or desktop app features?** ‚Üí Use `frontend-expert`
3. **Is this about AI integration, local models, or NLP?** ‚Üí Use `ai-ml-engineer`
4. **Is this about architecture review or complex system design?** ‚Üí Use `senior-architect-reviewer`
5. **Is this complex research or multi-step work?** ‚Üí Use `general-purpose`

**‚ùå COMMON MISTAKE**: Trying to implement directly instead of using Task tool with specialized agents

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH**: Use Task tool with appropriate subagent_type for all implementation work

### 7. Read Issue Requirements
- Understand ALL acceptance criteria
- Note any special requirements or constraints
- Identify dependencies or integration points

### 8. Plan Self-Contained Implementation
- Design approach that works independently
- Identify what mocks are needed for parallel development
- Plan vertical slice implementation (end-to-end functionality)

## üî¥ CRITICAL PROCESS VIOLATIONS

**If you start implementation work without completing the startup sequence:**

1. **STOP immediately**
2. Complete the startup sequence
3. Restart implementation with proper branch and issue assignment

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Reading files before creating feature branch
- Planning implementation before assigning issue
- Using TodoWrite without including startup sequence as first item
- Skipping git checkout step entirely

## ‚úÖ Mandatory Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to implementation, verify ALL of the following:

- [ ] Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Correct branch created/selected (individual vs parent branch strategy)
- [ ] Issue assigned using `bun run gh:assign <number> "@me"` (API command)
- [ ] Project status updated using `bun run gh:status <number> "In Progress"` (API command)
- [ ] Parent issue also updated if single-branch strategy
- [ ] Specialized agent selected (frontend-expert, ai-ml-engineer, etc.)
- [ ] Agent will be called with Task tool (NOT direct implementation)
- [ ] Issue requirements fully understood
- [ ] Self-contained implementation approach planned

**Quick Command Reference (BUN API COMMANDS):**
```bash
# Essential bun commands for startup sequence (no approval prompts)
bun run gh:assign <number> "@me"
bun run gh:status <number> "In Progress"

# Additional useful commands
bun run gh:create "Title" "Body"   # Create new issue
bun run gh:list                    # List all issues
bun run gh:view <number>          # View issue details
bun run gh:unassign <number> "@me" # Unassign issue
bun run gh:help                   # Show all available commands
```

## Next Steps

Once startup sequence is complete:
- **For new features**: Follow [Issue Workflow](issue-workflow.md)
- **For implementation**: Begin coding with self-contained approach
- **For questions**: Check [Troubleshooting](../guides/troubleshooting.md)

**Remember**: This sequence is mandatory for ALL team members and ensures consistent process adherence across AI agents and human engineers.
