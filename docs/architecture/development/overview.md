# NodeSpace Development Process Overview

**Universal guide for ALL development team members**: AI agents, human engineers, and architects. This process enables dependency-free development with vertical slicing and self-contained feature implementation for parallel development.

> ## 🤖👨‍💻 **UNIVERSAL PROCESS NOTICE**
> 
> **This process applies EQUALLY to:**
> - ✅ **AI Agents** (Claude, GPT, custom agents)
> - ✅ **Human Engineers** (frontend, backend, full-stack)
> - ✅ **Human Architects** (senior, principal, staff)
> - ✅ **Human Reviewers** (tech leads, peer reviewers)
> 
> **NO EXCEPTIONS**: All quality gates, requirements, and procedures are identical for AI agents and human team members. This ensures consistent quality and process adherence regardless of who (or what) implements or reviews code.

## 🎯 Core Development Principles

### 1. Dependency-Free Issue Design
Enable parallel development by designing issues that don't block each other:

```
✅ Parallel Development:
[FEATURE] Complete Text Node System (database + API + UI + tests)
[FEATURE] Complete Task Node System (database + API + UI + tests)
[FEATURE] Complete AI Chat System (database + API + UI + tests)
[INTEGRATION] Connect systems via shared interfaces
```

### 2. Self-Contained Feature Implementation
Each issue should be:
- **Independently implementable** - No waiting for other work
- **Demonstrable** - Shows working functionality
- **Testable** - Includes verification criteria
- **Valuable** - Delivers user-facing capability

### 3. Mock-First Development
Enable parallel work by mocking dependencies initially, then replacing with real implementations.

## ⚠️ Critical Requirements

### Mandatory Startup Sequence
**EVERY TEAM MEMBER (AI AGENTS & HUMANS) MUST COMPLETE BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. Create feature branch: `feature/issue-<number>-brief-description`
2. Assign issue to self: `bun run gh:assign <number> "@me"`
3. Update project status: Todo → In Progress
4. Read issue acceptance criteria and requirements
5. Plan self-contained implementation approach

### Zero-Tolerance Quality Policy
- **NO lint suppression allowed** - Fix issues properly, don't suppress warnings
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - All lint warnings and errors must be fixed with proper solutions
- **Universal standards** - Same requirements for AI agents and human engineers

## 🚨 Process Violations

**BLOCKING VIOLATIONS (IMMEDIATE REJECTION):**
- Creating PR with linting errors
- Skipping mandatory startup sequence
- Using npm instead of bun
- Implementing features without self-contained approach

**ACCOUNTABILITY:** Both implementer and reviewer are responsible for process adherence, regardless of human/AI status.
