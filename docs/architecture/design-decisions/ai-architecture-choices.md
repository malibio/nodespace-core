# AI Architecture Choices

## Overview

This document explains the architectural decisions around AI integration in NodeSpace, comparing different approaches and justifying the choice of embedded mistral.rs with Gemma 3n-E4B-it 8B.

## Decision Context

NodeSpace aims to be a desktop-first, all-in-one knowledge management application with deep AI integration. The AI architecture must support:

- **Offline Operation**: Work without internet connectivity
- **Responsive Performance**: Real-time interactions with minimal latency
- **Deep Integration**: AI woven into every aspect of the application
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reasonable resource usage for desktop deployment
- **Development Flexibility**: Support multiple backends during development

## AI Backend Comparison

### Option 1: External API Services (OpenAI, Anthropic)

**Pros:**

## Configuration Strategy

### Configurable AI Backend

To support development flexibility and future evolution, NodeSpace implements a configurable AI backend system:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum AIBackend {
    MistralRS {
        model_path: String,
        uqff_files: Vec<PathBuf>,
        gpu_layers: i32,
    },
    Ollama {
        endpoint: String,
        model: String,
    },
    Candle {
        model_config: CandleConfig,
    },
}
```

### Development vs Production

**Development Configuration:**
- Primary: mistral.rs for feature development
- Fallback: Ollama for experimentation
- Candle: Future experimentation when build issues resolve

**Production Configuration:**
- Primary: mistral.rs (embedded)
- Fallback: Graceful degradation with limited functionality

### Configuration Management

```toml
# config/default.toml
[ai]
backend = "mistral_rs"
model = "gemma-3n-8b-it"
fallback_backend = "none"

[ai.mistral_rs]
model_path = "/path/to/models/gemma-3n-8b-it-UQFF"
uqff_files = ["gemma-3n-8b-it-q4k-0.uqff"]
gpu_layers = -1  # Use all available GPU layers
context_size = 8192
temperature = 0.7

[ai.ollama]
endpoint = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "gemma2:9b"
timeout_seconds = 30

[ai.performance]
max_concurrent_requests = 1  # Single model instance
request_timeout_seconds = 120
memory_limit_gb = 8
```

## Integration Architecture

### AI Service Abstraction

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AIEngine: Send + Sync {
    async fn generate(&self, prompt: &str) -> Result<AIResponse, AIError>;
    async fn embed(&self, text: &str) -> Result<Vec<f32>, AIError>;
    async fn stream_generate(&self, prompt: &str) -> Result<AIResponseStream, AIError>;
    fn is_ready(&self) -> bool;
    fn model_info(&self) -> ModelInfo;
}
```

This abstraction allows:
- **Backend Switching**: Change AI providers transparently
- **Testing**: Mock AI responses for unit tests
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback when primary AI fails
- **Future Evolution**: Add new AI backends without code changes

### Context Management

NodeSpace implements sophisticated context management for AI interactions:

```rust
pub struct AIContext {
    pub node_id: String,
    pub node_type: String,
    pub workspace_context: WorkspaceContext,
    pub conversation_history: Vec<ChatMessage>,
    pub related_nodes: Vec<NodeReference>,
    pub semantic_context: Vec<SemanticMatch>,
}
```

**Context Sources:**
- **Current Node**: The node being processed
- **Related Content**: Linked and referenced nodes
- **Conversation History**: Previous AI interactions
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-similarity matches
- **Workspace Metadata**: Project and user context

## Performance Considerations
