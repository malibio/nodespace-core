# Workflow Canvas System

> **Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planned** - Future component for visual workflow creation  
> **Priority**: Medium (Post-Enhanced ContentEditable)  
> **Inspiration**: Google Opal's visual workflow interface

## Overview

The Workflow Canvas System will provide a visual, node-based interface for creating AI-powered workflows within NodeSpace. This system extends our existing hierarchical node architecture to support connected, executable workflow diagrams similar to Google Opal's approach.

## Vision Statement

Transform NodeSpace from a hierarchical knowledge management system into a comprehensive AI workflow platform where users can:
- **Visually design** AI processing pipelines
- **Connect existing nodes** into executable workflows  
- **Create mini-apps** through natural language and visual editing
- **Share workflows** as reusable components
- **Execute complex** multi-step AI operations

## Core Concepts

### Workflow Nodes vs Knowledge Nodes
```
Knowledge Nodes (Current)        Workflow Nodes (Planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hierarchical structure       â”œâ”€â”€ Connected graph structure
â”œâ”€â”€ Parent-child relationships   â”œâ”€â”€ Input-output relationships  
â”œâ”€â”€ Content-focused             â”œâ”€â”€ Process-focused
â””â”€â”€ Static organization         â””â”€â”€ Dynamic execution flow
```

### Workflow Node Types
Building on our existing node architecture:

**Input Nodes**
- User input forms
- File upload handlers
- External data sources
- Integration with existing TextNodes

**Processing Nodes** 
- AI model calls (Gemma integration)
- Text transformation
- Data analysis
- Custom logic nodes

**Output Nodes**
- Formatted results
- File generation
- External API calls
- Integration back to knowledge base

**Control Nodes**
- Conditional branching
- Loops and iteration
- Error handling
- Parallel execution

## Technical Architecture

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Extends Current Node Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// Current: packages/desktop-app/src/lib/types/
interface BaseNode {
  id: string
  type: string
  content: string
  // ... existing properties
}

// Planned: Workflow-specific extensions
interface WorkflowNode extends BaseNode {
  type: 'workflow-input' | 'workflow-process' | 'workflow-output' | 'workflow-control'
  position: { x: number, y: number }
  connections: Connection[]
  config: WorkflowNodeConfig
  executionState?: 'idle' | 'running' | 'complete' | 'error'
}

interface Connection {
  from: string      // source node id
  to: string        // target node id
  fromPort?: string // output port name
  toPort?: string   // input port name
  dataType?: string // type validation
}
```

**Component Architecture:**
```
src/lib/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow/                    # New workflow components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WorkflowCanvas.svelte   # Main canvas container
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WorkflowNode.svelte     # Individual workflow nodes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ConnectionLine.svelte   # Visual connections
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NodePalette.svelte      # Drag & drop node library
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ExecutionPanel.svelte   # Workflow execution controls
â”œâ”€â”€ TextNode.svelte             # Extended for workflow compatibility
â””â”€â”€ NodeTree.svelte             # May serve workflow hierarchies
```

### Library Integration Strategy

**Primary Recommendation: Svelvet**
- **Rationale**: Purpose-built for Svelte node workflows
- **Benefits**: Native integration, active development, workflow-focused
- **Trade-offs**: Additional dependency, learning curve

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Custom Implementation** - Full control, perfect integration with existing architecture
2. **SvelteFlow** - React Flow port, more mature feature set
3. **Hybrid Approach** - Svelvet foundation with custom extensions

### AI Integration Points

**Natural Language Workflow Creation**
```typescript
// Example: User describes workflow in plain text
const userPrompt = "Create a workflow that takes user input, summarizes it with AI, and saves to a new TextNode"

// AI generates workflow structure
interface GeneratedWorkflow {
  nodes: WorkflowNode[]
  connections: Connection[]  
  suggestedConfig: WorkflowConfig
}
```

**Smart Node Suggestions**
- AI-powered node recommendations based on workflow context
- Automatic connection suggestions
- Workflow optimization recommendations
- Error detection and resolution suggestions

## User Experience Design
