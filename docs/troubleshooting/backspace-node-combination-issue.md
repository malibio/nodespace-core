# Backspace Node Combination Issue

## Problem
When pressing backspace at the beginning of a node (cursor position 0), the node should combine with the previous node, merging their content. However, nodes disappear instead of combining properly.

## Root Cause
The data model updates correctly but Svelte UI binding doesn't reflect the changes. Debug logs show:

```
🔄 Before update - prevNode.content: Database operations
🔄 After update - prevNode.content: Database operationsCRUD operations with optimized queries
```

But the DOM still shows the original content.

## Investigation History
- **Data model logic**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Node removal**: ✅ Working correctly  
- **Content combination**: ✅ Working correctly in memory
- **UI reactivity**: ❌ NOT working - UI doesn't reflect data changes

## Potential Solutions
1. **Trigger explicit reactivity**: Force Svelte to detect changes
2. **Create new objects**: Instead of mutating existing objects, create new ones
3. **Use proper $state syntax**: Ensure Svelte 5 reactivity patterns are followed

## Lesson Learned
Always document complex debugging sessions to avoid repeating the same investigation.

## Status
- Investigation completed: January 2025
- Issue reproduced and root cause identified
- Solution pending implementation
