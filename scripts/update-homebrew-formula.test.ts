  # (unset, empty) version rather than the Formula's -- confirmed the hard

  # (empty version segment) before this was pulled out as a captured local.

  # Must be assigned BEFORE the on_macos/on_linux blocks below: Ruby
  # decides whether a bare identifier is a local-variable reference or a

  # has already been seen earlier in the source -- not at block-execution
  # time. \`brew style --fix\`'s automatic stanza reordering (which moves
  # on_macos/on_linux up, ahead of conflicts_with, per
  # FormulaAudit/ComponentsOrder) will happily move them above this
  # assignment too if run carelessly, which turns \`#{release_version}\`
  # into an undefined-local-variable-or-method error the moment the block
  # runs (confirmed by actually running \`brew style --fix\` and then \`brew
  # audit\` against the result). Keep this line above both blocks.

  # "..."\` is accepted by the formula DSL but has NO enforcement effect
  # (confirmed: installing this formula while the cask's bin/nodespace
  # symlink exists still succeeds); the cask-side mirror,
  # \`conflicts_with formula: "..."\`, doesn't exist at all in current
  # Homebrew (\`Unknown key: :formula. Valid keys are: :cask\`). So neither
  # side can declare this.
  #
  # What Homebrew actually does (also verified directly, with a synthetic
  # cask providing a real bin/nodespace symlink and then installing this
  # formula against it): the SECOND of the two to install still installs
  # its files into its own Cellar keg successfully, but \`brew link\` skips
  # the conflicting bin/nodespace symlink with a clear "already exists"
  # warning rather than either failing outright or silently overwriting
  # it -- and it skips linking bin/nodespaced too (Homebrew links a keg's
  # files as a unit, not file-by-file), even though nodespaced's name
  # doesn't collide with anything. \`brew link --overwrite nodespace-cli\`
  # (or the equivalent for the cask) resolves it, consciously choosing
  # which copy PATH should resolve to. \`brew services start nodespace-cli\`
  # still works either way -- see the caveats below.

  # The CLI is useless without the daemon it talks to over a Unix socket
  # -- this formula installs both, matching what the cask's .app bundle
  # already ships (nodespaced alongside the CLI).

      name on PATH: whichever installs second gets its bin/nodespace link
      skipped with a warning rather than silently overwritten. Run
      \`brew link --overwrite nodespace-cli\` (or \`--overwrite nodespace\`

      \`brew services start nodespace-cli\` and running \`nodespaced\`
