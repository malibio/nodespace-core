/**
 * Preflight gate — refuse to score scenarios when the environment cannot
 * produce a valid result.
 *
 * An eval that scores a broken environment is worse than no eval, because its
 * output gets cited. The motivating case: a matrix run reported its two
 * "no tools called" scenarios as PASSING while every turn was dying on
 * `Context window exceeded` before inference ran. A turn that times out calls
 * no tools, so a negative assertion scores it green. The run produced a
 * plausible partial result from an environment where nothing worked, and it
 * took reading daemon logs to notice.
 *
 * Each check below answers a question whose wrong answer silently corrupts
 * scores rather than failing loudly:
 *   1. daemon reachable       — otherwise every turn errors and every negative
 *                               assertion passes
 *   2. requested model loaded — otherwise the score belongs to a different
 *                               model than the one it will be filed under
 *   3. granted window > prompt— the case above; catches in ~2s what otherwise
 *                               takes ~8min of inference to half-discover
 *
 * Failures exit with EXIT_ENVIRONMENT, distinct from a scenario failure, and
 * no results file is written.
