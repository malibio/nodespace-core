/**
 * Agent-behavior eval — end-to-end graph outcomes.
 *
 * Asserts a structured, machine-checkable expectation per scenario rather than
 * capturing prose for a human to read: what the user's graph looks like when
 * the turn ends.
 *
 * This is the third eval layer, distinct from the other two:
 *   - chat::parser::tests           — tool-call PARSING shape (fixtures)
 *   - scripts/eval/fixtures/routing — skill ROUTING accuracy (which skill fires)
 *   - this                          — END-TO-END behavior (did the requested
 *                                     change actually reach storage)
 *
 * OUTCOME, NOT TRAJECTORY
 *
 * This fixture used to score TRAJECTORY — which tool fired, how many times, in
 * what order — and that disagreed with the product in three measured ways:
 *
 *   - A correct result scored as a failure. A model reaching the right end
 *     state by a shorter path (update_node with no preceding resolve_query)
 *     lost a point for the path rather than the result.
 *   - Self-correction scored as a failure. A create_node rejected for a missing
 *     node_type, corrected by the model and persisted on the second call, red-
 *     lined on an exactly-once rule — punishing the recovery behavior we want.
 *   - Severity was flat. Two search_nodes calls (wasted latency, nothing
 *     persisted) scored identically to two create_schema calls (a spurious type
 *     the user has to clean up).
 *
 * Each scenario's `end` clause is now THE score, and severity falls out of it
 * for free rather than needing a severity table: a repeated read changes
 * nothing and passes, while a repeated schema creation leaves an extra type
 * behind and fails `createdSchemas`. See ../end-state.ts for the clause model
 * and ../graph.ts for how end state is captured.
 *
 * `expect` — the old trajectory assertion — is KEPT on every scenario and
 * still evaluated, but as a diagnostic recorded beside the score rather than as
 * the score. It answers the question outcome grading cannot ("how did the model
 * get there"), which is what a debugging session actually needs, and a scenario
 * where the two disagree is the signal worth reading after a run.
 *
 * Under ADR-038 routing happens in a separate stage before the acting turn, so
 * trajectory assertions check for the TARGET tool tolerating routing calls,
 * never raw tool count.
 *
 * THE DOMAIN IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT, NOT DECORATION
 *
 * Model-lock decisions (ADR-046, ADR-056) and every model re-evaluation since
 * are scored off this matrix, so whatever domain the scenarios are written in
 * is the domain native-model selection is actually being decided on. That made
 * the original scenario set — equipment checkouts, album and venue trackers —
 * an active problem rather than a cosmetic one: it selected models on their
 * ability to track laser cutters, while the product's claim is context
 * infrastructure for AI-native development.
 *
 * The scenarios are therefore written in NodeSpace's own working domain:
 * feature write-ups and their sign-off state, the calls a team makes about how
 * a system is built, planning cycles, work tied to the decision that
 * constrains it. See ../../../../nodespace-docs/strategy/{vision,beliefs,
 * principles}.md for the framing this tracks.
 *
 * The MECHANICS are unchanged by that re-theme and are the reason the scenario
 * set was re-themed in place rather than duplicated into a second fixture: the
 * expectation clauses are properties of the expectation model, not of the
 * vocabulary, so re-theming keeps every one of them — and keeps every scenario
 * `id`, so a pre-re-theme baseline still joins against a post-re-theme run.
 *
 * GROUPS CASCADE, SO SETUP IS NOT SCORED
 *
 * Scenarios in a group share a chat node and run in order, so an early failure
 * craters the rest and the results stop being independent observations. One
 * ambiguous verb in 11a once cost three points: itself, plus 11c (which had no
 * node to link) and 11d (which had no edge to traverse) — one failure counted
 * three times, inflating variance and making per-scenario counts misleading.
 *
 * Turns that exist only to establish state (11a, 11b) are therefore marked
 * `setup: true`: run and recorded, asserted, warned about if they fail, but
 * NOT scored. Their state still reaches their successors; their phantom
 * failures no longer reach the denominator.
 *
 * WINNABILITY IS A HARD CONSTRAINT ON WORDING
 *
 * Each chain builds its own schema in its first scenario, and every later
 * prompt in that chain must name only values that schema can actually hold. A
 * prompt asking for a field the type has nowhere to put is unwinnable: the
 * model degrades reasonably (folding the value into the node's text) and
 * scores red for it, and the fixture is then measuring itself rather than the
 * model. See scenario 9's note and #1846.
 *
 * Scenario wording must stay independent of packages/agent/src/agent_guidance.rs.
 * `guidance_is_not_contaminated_by_eval_prompts` enforces it by parsing the
 * `prompt:` literals out of this file: a prompt that also appears in guidance
 * turns a passing scenario into proof that the model can copy a memorized
 * example, and prompt tuning then has a degenerate solution. The dev-workflow
 * domain raises that risk rather than lowering it — the seeded skill
 * descriptions already name Spec, ADR and Ticket — so prompts here are written
 * around those terms and checked against the guard, not assumed clear of it.

 *     scores off the diff between the pre- and post-turn snapshots — so an

      // they carried are re-rendered as terse "Fact: ..." lines plus a
      // system-role write record, so the turn could see BOTH endpoint ids, the
      // `mentions` edge, and the decision's own text.
      //
      // The failure was the opposite of a missing fact: the history HANDED the
      // model the answer. "What did we settle on" was answerable by reading the
      // decision's text three messages up, and `TOOL_STRATEGY_RULES`'s first
      // bullet tells the model to answer such a turn directly in text. Every
      // model returning `tools: []` was following its instructions against a
      // prompt that did not need the graph.
      //
      // A scenario measuring traversal must therefore ask for something the
      // conversation CANNOT answer. Within this chain that is a hard
      // constraint: the terse fact for each created node states its title, its
      // type AND its id, so every read-only question about either endpoint is
      // answerable from history. Re-wording alone cannot fix that — which is
      // why this scenario now asks for the CURRENT set of links on the
      // decision, and 11c2 records a second edge for the set to be non-trivial.

  // The distinction is the whole reason this comment is long. An earlier draft
  // of this group claimed the comparative forced a read, on the strength of a
  // daemon test showing the ordering words are absent from history. That
  // reasoning does not hold, and the counter-example is one glance at the
  // rendered history:
  //
  //   Fact: a feature_writeup node was created with title 'checkout rewrite'
  //         and properties estimated_days 9 (id nodespace://fw10).
  //   Fact: a feature_writeup node was created with title 'search indexer'
  //         and properties estimated_days 21 (id nodespace://fw11).
  //   Fact: a feature_writeup node was created with title 'audit log export'
  //         and properties estimated_days 4 (id nodespace://fw12).
  //
  // Three adjacent lines, uniform format, every estimate AND every id present
  // as literal text. `max(9, 21, 4)` is an in-context comparison, so a model
  // can go straight to update_node with the right id and never read anything —
  // and that is a CORRECT answer, not a shortcut. Absence of the word "biggest"
  // proves the ordering is not STATED; it does not prove the ordering is not
  // DERIVABLE, and derivability is what makes a reference indirect. This is a
  // subtler repeat of the scenario 6 defect #2242 found, and it survived an
  // absence proof precisely because that proof asserted the wrong property.
  //
  // Every scalar a scored turn writes is replayed inline by
  // `terse_write_fact`, so no value this chain writes can be made underivable
  // by wording alone. Closing #2248 properly needs a referent the agent never
  // wrote — which needs out-of-band seeding the runner deliberately does not
  // support ("Assert, do not own", runner.ts; "never starts or seeds
  // anything", env.ts).
  //
  // So what is this group worth keeping for? It is still strictly harder than
  // scenario 6: 6's referent was a direct string match on a value the prompt
  // itself named ("the five-day one" against `estimated_days 5`), whereas this
  // one requires ranking three values before any id can be chosen. That is a
  // real capability and nothing else in the matrix covers it.
  //
  // `toolSequence` deliberately does NOT live here, though a draft of 12d used
  // it. Naming `[search_nodes, update_node]` pins one of four legitimate read
  // spellings AND reds out the shortest correct route (update_node alone, which
  // the inline estimates make valid) — both the mistake #2242 was cleaning up.
  // It lives on scenario 13 instead, whose route is genuinely forced because
  // its referent is seeded out of band and therefore absent from history.

      // `noRetry` on update_node rather than a read-then-write SUBSEQUENCE,

      // route entirely: as the group header explains, the estimates are all
      // inline in history, so `update_node` alone is a correct answer here.
      // Scenario 11c documents the same "do not pin the spelling" reasoning.
      //
      // What is left worth asserting on the trajectory is that the write
      // happened and was not a blind retry loop. `minCalls: 1` is required —
      // without it, bare `noRetry` passes on a turn where update_node never

      // the reference WRONGLY still calls update_node and still persists a
      // property, so a clause that only counted properties would score picking
      // the wrong node green. Naming the node is the whole assertion.
      //
      // `updatedNode` rather than `createdNode` for scenario 6's reason: a turn
      // that records the sign-off on a NEW node leaves the original untouched
      // and is a real failure.
      //
      // `minProperties: 2` rather than `properties: { signed_off: true }`
      // because this group's type is model-built — naming the key would measure
      // the fixture's vocabulary guess rather than the model's behavior (the
      // same reason `createdSchemas` is a count).
      //
      // 2, not 1, because the node already arrives carrying its estimate from
      // 12b2: `minProperties: 1` would be satisfied by that pre-existing value
      // alone and score green on a turn that resolved the right node and then
      // persisted NOTHING — the `updated: true` with `property_count: 0` shape
      // scenario 9 documents reaching production.
      //
      // KNOWN RESIDUAL WEAKNESS, stated rather than papered over. This asserts
      // that a second property became populated, NOT that it holds the right
      // value: a model writing `signed_off: false` would still pass, since
      // `populatedCount` counts `false` as present. The clause vocabulary
      // cannot express "some property equals boolean true" — `hasPropertyValue`
      // intercepts `true` as "any present value" (end-state.ts:161) and its
      // string branch rejects booleans outright (:177), so neither `true` nor
      // `"true"` expresses it. Naming the key would reintroduce the vocabulary
      // guess this group's type is deliberately free of. The gap is narrow (a
      // model that resolves correctly and then writes the OPPOSITE of what was
      // asked) and is left rather than closed by weakening something else.

  // Indirect-reference decomposition (scenario 13), on SEEDED state.
  //
  // THIS IS THE SCENARIO #2248 ASKED FOR, and the reason it needs seeding is
  // the finding two prior attempts produced.
  //
  // Scenario 6 asserted a resolve-then-act chain for "the five-day one". #2242
  // found the referent was a direct string match: a create_node write is
  // replayed into later turns as a terse fact carrying its property values AND
  // its id inline, so the discriminator was already in the prompt. Scenario 12
  // then tried a COMPARATIVE over three written values; #2250's review found
  // that fails the same way for a subtler reason — the values are all inline,
  // so the ranking is derivable in-context without reading anything.
  //
  // The generalisation, which is what makes this group's shape necessary:
  // NO VALUE A SCORED TURN WRITES CAN BE THE REFERENT. Every scalar the agent
  // writes is replayed (`terse_write_fact`), so the target is always in the
  // prompt as literal text. A genuinely indirect reference needs a referent the
  // agent NEVER WROTE.
  //
  // Hence `seedGroup`: these incident records are created through the CLI
  // before the group's first turn. `completed_writes` is built only from a
  // turn's own tool executions, so seeded nodes are absent from the rendered
  // chat history entirely — no title, no property value, no id.
  //
  // "ABSENT FROM HISTORY" IS NOT "ABSENT FROM THE PROMPT", and the difference
  // is exactly where the two prior attempts went wrong, so state the boundary
  // rather than restate the claim. Seeding creates a SCHEMA as well as the
  // instances, and workspace context retrieves schemas semantically and
  // interpolates them into the system prompt — so the model DOES see that an
  // `incident_report` type exists with an `on_call` field. What it does not see
  // is any instance: only `"schema"`-type nodes are retrieved that way, so the
  // three titles and the `rowan` -> `search index corruption` mapping stay out.
  //
  // That is the property 13 actually rests on. Knowing the type and field names
  // tells the model HOW TO ASK; it does not tell it WHICH incident to update.
  // The read is still forced. Recorded by
  // `scenario_13_seeded_schema_reaches_the_prompt_but_its_instances_do_not`
  // (packages/core/src/ops/context_ops.rs), which proves the rendering half —
  // that schema vocabulary reaches the prompt.
  //
  // WHAT NOTHING CURRENTLY GUARDS, so it is written down rather than assumed:
  // 13 depends on only `"schema"`-type nodes being retrieved into workspace
  // context (`semantic_search_nodes_of_type` in context_ops). If that ever
  // widens to instance nodes, 13's referent becomes directly matchable from
  // the system prompt and the scenario degrades into the string match that
  // cost scenarios 6 and 12 their indirection — and no test in this repo would
  // fail. That retrieval call is the thing to check before changing workspace
  // context.
  //
  // Pinned by `scenario_13_seeded_referent_is_absent_from_history` in
  // daemon/src/services/local_agent_service.rs, which renders the real history
  // for this group and asserts the referent, the type and the on-call name are
  // all absent — the inverse of scenario 6's test, which pins that ITS referent
  // is present.
  //
  // This is also the only scenario where A READ is genuinely forced, which is
  // why `toolSequence` lives here: with the referent absent from history, no
  // direct write can reach the right id. That is the assertion kind #2242 left
  // dead and neither prior attempt could honestly revive.
  //
  // WHICH read is not forced, and saying otherwise would repeat the overclaim
  // that sank both prior attempts: `resolve_query` reaches the same node. The
  // subsequence names `search_nodes` because that is the route the winnability
  // test proves; a model resolving otherwise shows as a trajectory mismatch
  // against a passing outcome. That is acceptable only because `expect` is a
  // diagnostic rather than the score (#2243).
