/**
 * Graph end-state capture and comparison.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The matrix used to score TRAJECTORY — which tool fired, how many times, in
 * what order. That disagrees with the product in three measured ways:
 *
 *   - A correct result scored as a failure. A model that reached the right end
 *     state by a shorter path (update_node without a preceding resolve_query)
 *     lost a point for the path, not the result.
 *   - Self-correction scored as a failure. A rejected create_node, corrected by
 *     the model and persisted on the second call, red-lined on an exactly-once
 *     rule — punishing the recovery behavior we want.
 *   - Severity flattened. Two search_nodes calls (wasted latency, nothing
 *     persisted) scored identically to two create_schema calls (a spurious type
 *     in the user's graph) and to zero search_nodes on a query (a wrong answer).
 *
 * Asserting on the graph's END STATE fixes all three at once, and the third
 * falls out for free rather than needing a severity table: two search_nodes
 * calls change nothing and pass, two create_schema calls leave an unexpected
 * type behind and fail the same `noUnexpectedSchemas` clause that every other
 * write scenario already carries.
 *
 * This is tau-bench's design — the agent operates on a database through an API
 * and is graded by diffing final DB state against a goal state — and it is the
 * closest published analogue to what NodeSpace's agent actually does.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT ASSERTED
 *
 * A snapshot is deliberately NOT a whole-database dump. It covers what the
 * scenarios act on — nodes (with their properties), schemas, and edges between
 * observed nodes — read back through the same `nodespace` CLI every eval turn
 * already goes through. Anything outside that (embeddings, collections,
 * lifecycle transitions) is invisible here by design: an assertion this module
 * cannot express belongs in a scenario's trajectory diagnostic, not in a
 * silently-passing end-state clause.

 * lined correct writes: measured against DeepSeek V4 Pro, scenarios 9, 10b and

 * identified by matching `node_type`, not by guessing from shape.
 *
 * NOTE: the CLI now flattens properties itself (`output.rs::node_to_json`), so
 * against a current build this function's wrapper branch never fires and it
 * simply copies. It is kept because `NS_BIN` is overridable and defaults to a
 * prebuilt `target/release/nodespace` that can predate that change — exactly
 * the stale-binary case `preflight.ts` already warns about. Unwrapping a shape
 * the CLI no longer emits is harmless; failing to unwrap one an older binary
 * still does would silently zero out `populatedCount` and red-line correct
 * writes. This is input tolerance at the harness boundary, not a compatibility

 * with it, so a node whose ONLY difference is a persistence-bumped schema
 * version no longer counts as changed (measured: 1 changed node before, 0
 * after). That is the intended direction — `expectNoWrites` should not red-line
 * a read scenario because persistence touched a field the model never saw — but
 * it is a deliberate loosening of the one comparator behind a false-PASS path,
 * so it is recorded here rather than left to be inferred, and pinned by
 * `diffSnapshots` in end-state.test.ts.
 *
 * The loosening is bounded to keys in `PERSISTENCE_KEYS`. Any field a model can

 * SOUNDNESS RESTS ON THE INPUT DOMAIN, so state it: this is the only

 * originate. It is safe because the values it sees always come from
 * `JSON.parse` of the CLI's stdout (see `toSnapshotNode`), which can only
 * produce objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and null. The `?? "null"`
 * fallback collapses `undefined` with `null`, and a `Date` would render as
 * `{}` — neither is reachable from parsed JSON. Feed this anything that did
 * not come from a parse and that guarantee is gone.
