/**
 * Shared "clone, write, commit, push" mechanics for pushing an automated
 * update to a generated-only public repo this org owns.
 *
 * Used by update-homebrew-cask.ts (NodeSpaceAI/homebrew-nodespace,
 * Casks/nodespace.rb), update-homebrew-formula.ts (same repo,
 * Formula/nodespace-cli.rb), and publish-skill-repo.ts
 * (NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-skill, skills/nodespace/) -- pulled out here so the
 * credential-scrubbing safety net (covering every step, not just the clone --
 * see pushFilesToRepo's inner try/catch) can't drift out of sync between
 * three copies of the same ~35 lines. Each caller still owns its own
 * rendering, digest resolution, and drift-check logic; this file is only the
 * network/git plumbing they share.
 *
 * Originally homebrew-tap-push.ts, hardcoded to the tap repo alone -- now
 * generalized (`repo` is a parameter, not a module constant) now that a
 * second, unrelated target repo needs the identical mechanics.
