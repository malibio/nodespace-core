/**
 * Sync the Homebrew formula (NodeSpaceAI/homebrew-nodespace,
 * Formula/nodespace-cli.rb) to a published nodespace-core release.
 *
 * Sibling of scripts/update-homebrew-cask.ts, which does the same job for
 * the `nodespace` cask (the full GUI app). `nodespace-cli` is the headless
 * CLI + daemon path (`brew install nodespace-cli`) and ships a different
 * asset shape: 3 platform/arch targets (macOS arm64, Linux arm64, Linux
 * x86_64 -- see REQUIRED_HEADLESS_TARGETS, imported from
 * publish-install-script.ts, the same list install.sh pins against) x 2
 * binaries (`nodespace`, `nodespaced`) = 6 digests, versus the cask's
 * single arm64 .dmg. Before this script existed, the formula (added in
 * nodespace-core#2146) hardcoded its own version and all 6 digests,
 * independent of the cask's sync automation -- the same "hand-maintained
 * artifact silently drifts" failure mode already fixed once for the cask,
 * reintroduced for the formula in the very PR that added it.
 *
 * The formula's `on_intel do odie(...) end` block under `on_macos` (no
 * macOS Intel build) stays hardcoded rather than becoming conditional on
 * asset presence: unlike the cask's now-removed Intel .dmg leg (which
 * `build-tauri` used to produce until nodespace-core#2169), release.yml's
 * `build-headless` matrix has never had a macOS x86_64 leg at all -- there
 * is no CI job this script could observe flip from absent to present.
 * Making this conditional now would be speculative generality for a
 * scenario with no live path to occur under the current pipeline.
 *
 * It never hand-types a digest: every sha256 is computed locally with
 * node:crypto against the actual bytes downloaded from the release asset
 * URL GitHub reports for that file, exactly like update-homebrew-cask.ts.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/update-homebrew-formula.ts <version>            # dry run -- prints the
 *                                                                    # formula + diff, pushes nothing
 *   bun run scripts/update-homebrew-formula.ts <version> --push      # pushes to homebrew-nodespace's
 *                                                                     # main branch (requires
 *                                                                     # HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN)
 *   bun run scripts/update-homebrew-formula.ts drift-check           # compares the tap's live formula
 *                                                                     # version against the latest
 *                                                                     # published release; exits 1
 *                                                                     # (loud) on mismatch
 *
 * `--push` requires HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN: the same PAT (contents: write on
 * NodeSpaceAI/homebrew-nodespace) update-homebrew-cask.ts uses -- one repo
 * secret, shared by both sync jobs.
 *
 * Where this hooks in: release.yml's `sync-homebrew-formula` job runs this
 * script with `--push` on the `release` event, gated on `build-headless`
 * finishing (not cancelled) -- the same gating `sync-install-script` uses
 * for the same reason: `build-headless` is a single job with an internal
 * matrix, so `needs` only exposes its aggregate result, not individual
 * legs. This script's own resolveFormulaDigests() re-verifies the specific
 * assets it needs via `gh release view` and fails loudly (a hard error,
 * matching nodespace-core#2171's "missing arm64 is a hard error, not a
 * warning" precedent for the cask) if any of the 6 is missing -- every one
 * of REQUIRED_HEADLESS_TARGETS is required for this formula, not optional,
 * so there is no partial/degraded formula to render. `homebrew-drift-check.yml`
 * is an independent scheduled backstop that catches a stale formula even
 * if the sync job itself was skipped or failed silently.
