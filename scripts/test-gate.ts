/**
 * Local pre-push test gate.
 *
 * Runs the full test pyramid (frontend, skill, Rust, e2e) before code leaves
 * the machine. This repo has no CI runner for tests — this hook is the only
 * gate. See ADR-047.
 *
 * This gate only activates once Husky has wired it in via the `prepare`
 * script (i.e. after `bun install`). It is a local convenience, not a
 * server-side enforcement backstop — a push from a machine that never ran
 * `bun install` is not gated.
 *
 * Bypass: git push --no-verify. Reserved for WIP Handoff Commits (see
 * CLAUDE.md) — multi-session work, approaching context limits, a natural
 * breakpoint, or before a risky change. Not a general-purpose escape hatch
 * for "the suite is slow right now."

// Stages two of the things nodespace-app's build.rs (tauri_build::build())
// insists on: the `nodespace-skill-installer` externalBin and the
// `resources/skill/**/*` glob, neither of which has a tracked file to fall
// back on. Cheap enough (a tsc build + file copy) to run unconditionally
// rather than rely on a prior `dev:tauri`/`tauri:build` having staged it. This
// now runs BEFORE `test:all`, because `rust:test` compiles that crate to cover
// its `src/` unit tests. The remaining sidecars aren't staged here — a cold
// build of them takes minutes, too much for every push — so `rust:test` checks
// every required path up front and names the command that produces each.
// Staleness check, not a fix for the merge race — see check-branch-behind.ts.
// Runs first so the warning (if any) is visible before the several-minutes
// pyramid below, and never blocks: a fetch/rev-list failure degrades to a
// skipped check rather than a failed push.

  // crate's `src/` unit tests are in-process, need no daemon binary, and run
  // headless in ~2s at full parallelism, so `rust:test` (above, via test:all)
  // runs them alongside every other crate's. Narrowing this step is what
  // leaves them free to do that — both a bare `cargo test -p nodespace-app`
  // and `--tests` would additionally re-run the lib/bin unittest targets
  // here, needlessly, under the =1 cap only this suite requires. (`--tests`
  // means "every target with test = true", not "the tests/ directory".)
  //
  // --test-threads=1: every test in this suite spawns a real nodespaced
  // process, which loads a real embedding model (Metal shader compilation
  // included) before its socket binds — far more load-sensitive than
  // nodespace-core's in-process assertions (which cap concurrency the same
  // way, see rust:test above, though that suite has no equivalent per-test
  // process-spawn cost). Cargo already runs each tests/*.rs file's binary
  // sequentially, but within one binary (e.g. node_crud_tauri_seam_test.rs's
  // 5 tests) all tests run concurrently by default. `SpawnedDaemon::spawn()`
  // happens BEFORE any test acquires test-support's CONNECT_MUTEX (which
  // only serializes the health-wait/connect step, not the spawn itself), so
  // without this flag several real daemon processes can be mid-spawn at
  // once fully uncoordinated — self-inflicted CPU/GPU contention this suite
  // creates on its own, made worse by whatever else is running on the
  // machine. Tried --test-threads=2 first; it still reproduced the same
  // daemon-health timeout under real background load, so =1 was needed, not
  // just a higher timeout. Serializing daemon spawns costs almost nothing
  // here — the suite's total wall-clock is dominated by the one
  // real-inference test (~25-40s), and the rest are sub-second each — so =1
  // trades no meaningful time for real reliability.
  // "*" stays quoted: bun's $ glob-expands a bare * against the working
  // directory, which would hand cargo a list of repo filenames instead.
