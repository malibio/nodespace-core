/**
 * Publish the NodeSpace Agent Skill to NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-skill -- the
 * public repo external agent harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI,
 * OpenCode, ...) import to get NodeSpace's Agent Skill without installing
 * the NodeSpace app first.
 *
 * `@nodespaceai/skill` is not published to npm and this script does not
 * change that: the desktop app runs `packages/skill`'s built installer
 * directly with `bun` (never `npx`/`npm` -- see
 * packages/desktop-app/src-tauri/src/skill_setup.rs), so npm publishing was
 * never actually required for the app's own install path -- the package
 * never landing on the registry never blocked anything real. This repo is
 * the sole distribution channel for the harness-native import path.
 *
 * It never hand-writes the skill body: it copies `packages/skill/SKILL.md`
 * (the body -- the checked-in file carries no frontmatter, see
 * packages/skill/src/types.ts) and `packages/skill/references/cli.md`
 * verbatim, whatever they currently are. If a future change to
 * `packages/skill` shrinks SKILL.md to a stub with guidance fetched from the
 * graph at runtime instead, this script keeps working unmodified -- it has
 * no assumption baked in about the body's size or shape, only about where it
 * lives on disk.
 *
 * The published SKILL.md gets the same shared frontmatter every installer
 * target uses (`buildSkillFrontmatter` in packages/skill/src/agents.ts:
 * `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools` -- every field is one the Agent
 * Skills spec (agentskills.io) defines, `allowed-tools` included: it's
 * listed as one of the spec's six frontmatter fields, "Experimental" but not
 * Claude-Code-specific, so sharing it across all four installer targets --
 * and this generic publish target -- is spec-compliant, not a Claude Code
 * leak), plus one field the installer path doesn't set: `compatibility`,
 * stamped with the released NodeSpace app version so a user importing this
 * repo can tell which app version a given revision targets. That version
 * comes from the same release tag update-homebrew-cask.ts takes as its
 * `<version>` argument -- itself the canonical app version
 * scripts/check-version-sync.ts enforces (tauri.conf.json) -- not
 * re-derived from packages/skill/package.json's own version field, which is
 * NOT kept in sync with the app (it still reads 0.2.0 while the app ships
 * 0.2.2) and would be a second, already-drifted source of truth.
 *
 * This is a generated-only repo, same contract as homebrew-nodespace
 * (NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-skill's own README says so): every push here
 * overwrites by rendering fresh from `packages/skill`, never reads back or
 * merges what's already there. Hand edits to NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-skill do
 * not survive the next release.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/publish-skill-repo.ts <version>            # dry run -- prints
 *                                                                # the rendered files, pushes nothing
 *   bun run scripts/publish-skill-repo.ts <version> --push      # pushes to nodespace-skill's
 *                                                                # main branch (requires
 *                                                                # SKILL_REPO_TOKEN)
 *
 * `--push` requires SKILL_REPO_TOKEN: a PAT (or fine-grained token) with
 * `contents: write` on NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-skill, set as a repo secret --
 * the same shape as HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN and WEBSITE_DEPLOY_TOKEN, one
 * dedicated token per external target repo rather than one shared credential
 * (a token scoped to nodespace-skill cannot be used to push anywhere else if
 * it ever leaks). `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to nodespace-core only
 * and cannot push cross-repo.
 *
 * Where this hooks in: release.yml's `sync-skill-repo` job runs this script
 * with `--push` on the `release` event (the same `published`-only trigger
 * the Homebrew tap sync uses, so a release saved as a draft and published
 * later fires this exactly once).
