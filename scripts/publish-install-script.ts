/**
 * Pin nodespace-website's install.sh (the `curl -fsSL https://nodespace.ai/
 * install.sh | sh` bootstrap installer) to a published nodespace-core
 * release.
 *
 * install.sh is a committed static file in NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-website
 * -- it is not generated from a template here. What this script owns is
 * exactly one line inside that file:
 *
 *   NODESPACE_CLI_VERSION="v0.2.0"
 *
 * install.sh deliberately does NOT fetch "latest" from GitHub Releases --
 * this repo's release workflow publishes a release (making it "latest")
 * before that release's build-and-upload jobs even start, so "latest" can
 * point at a release with a missing or partial asset set for several
 * minutes after it's created. This script is the thing that advances the
 * pin, and it only runs after this repo's own release build jobs report
 * success (see the release workflow's sync-install-script job, a sibling
 * of the job that keeps the Homebrew cask in sync the same way -- both
 * exist because a hand-maintained downstream artifact silently drifted
 * for two months before anything caught it).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/publish-install-script.ts <version>            # dry run --
 *                                                                   # prints the diff, pushes nothing
 *   bun run scripts/publish-install-script.ts <version> --push      # pushes to nodespace-website's
 *                                                                    # main branch (requires
 *                                                                    # WEBSITE_DEPLOY_TOKEN)
 *
 * `--push` requires WEBSITE_DEPLOY_TOKEN: a PAT (or fine-grained token)
 * with `contents: write` on NodeSpaceAI/nodespace-website, set as a repo
 * secret once this is wired into the release flow -- `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`
 * is scoped to nodespace-core only and cannot push cross-repo (same
 * constraint the Homebrew cask sync's token documents).
