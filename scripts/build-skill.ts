/**
 * Build packages/skill and stage its runtime output where the desktop app
 * expects to find it.
 *
 * packages/skill ships two ways, both produced here (see
 * packages/desktop-app/src-tauri/src/skill_setup.rs's `Installer` enum for
 * which one a given launch actually uses):
 *
 *   1. **The compiled standalone binary** (`bun build --compile`) — the
 *      preferred path: no external bun/node dependency at all, so a packaged
 *      app's end user never hits "runtime not found". Staged as
 *      `binaries/nodespace-skill-installer-{triple}`, declared as an
 *      `externalBin` sidecar in tauri.conf.json (same mechanism as
 *      `nodespaced`/`nodespace`).
 *   2. **The plain JS build** (`tsc` compiles src/ -> dist/, packages/skill/
 *      package.json's own `build` script) — the fallback for a platform this
 *      hasn't been wired up for yet, or a dev/source checkout. Needs `bun` or
 *      `node` on $PATH to run. Staged (dist/, shims/, SKILL.md, references/,
 *      package.json for its `"type": "module"` marker) into
 *      packages/desktop-app/src-tauri/resources/skill/, a `resources` entry
 *      in tauri.conf.json — also where the compiled binary's
 *      `--resource-root` points, since it can't infer that from its own
 *      compiled-executable location the way dist/install.js can from
 *      `import.meta.url`.
 *
 * Tauri copies declared resources/externalBin into the build cache for
 * `tauri dev` too, so this single staging step serves both dev and packaged
 * builds. Run automatically before `dev:tauri` and `tauri:build` (see
 * packages/desktop-app/package.json) so neither is ever stale.
 *
 * The compiled binary is only produced for the CURRENT host here — this
 * script is for local development, same scope as `build-sidecars.ts`
 * (real cross-platform release builds compile natively on each platform's
 * own CI runner; see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
 *
 * ## Why both halves are idempotent
 *
 * Everything this script writes is an input to `nodespace-app`'s build
 * script: `tauri-build` emits a `cargo:rerun-if-changed` for every
 * `externalBin` and every `resources` entry (`copy_binaries` /
 * `copy_resources` in `tauri-build-2.6.2/src/lib.rs`). So a single rewritten
 * byte — or merely a fresher mtime on an otherwise identical file —
 * invalidates the crate and forces a full rebuild. Since `build:skill` runs
 * automatically before `dev:tauri` and `tauri:build`, an unconditional
 * rewrite taxes every pass through the desktop dev loop even when nothing
 * under `packages/skill/` changed.
 *
 * Both halves therefore no-op when they would reproduce what is already
 * staged, with each check matched to what that half actually costs:
 *
 *   - The **compile** (`bun build --compile`, ~58MB) is guarded by mtime —
 *     the same comparison shape as `build_support.rs`'s `sync_stale_sidecar`
 *     — so the expensive step is skipped outright, not run and discarded.
 *   - The **resource staging** is guarded by content. `tsc` runs without
 *     `--incremental` here, so it rewrites every `dist/*.js` on each run with
 *     byte-identical output and a fresh mtime; an mtime check would see churn
 *     that isn't really there. Comparing bytes and writing only what actually
 *     differs leaves unchanged files' mtimes — and the crate — untouched.
