//! Drift and completeness guards for `packages/skill/SKILL.md`.
//!
//! The skill is what an external agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI,
//! OpenCode) reads to learn what NodeSpace is and how to drive it. Anything it
//! restates by hand can fall out of step with the code, and nothing catches it
//! — the agent simply acts on stale instructions. These tests make each source
//! of truth structurally responsible for its own coverage.
//!
//! ## The contract runs one way
//!
//! Every *source* must have a rendered section. It is **never** asserted that
//! every section has a source. That asymmetry is deliberate and load-bearing:
//! judgment prose — what NodeSpace is, when to reach for it, how to install it
//! — has no upstream to render from and must survive regeneration untouched. A
//! test demanding the reverse would delete exactly the content a generator
//! cannot produce.
//!
//! ## Why enumeration is dynamic
//!
//! Coverage is computed by walking `Cli::command()` and `seed_skill_nodes()`
//! at test time, not by comparing against a hand-maintained list of names. A
//! checked-in list is itself a second representation that drifts, and it fails
//! in the worst direction — silently, by omission. This mirrors the existing
//! precedent in `agent_guidance.rs`'s `guidance_corpus()`.
