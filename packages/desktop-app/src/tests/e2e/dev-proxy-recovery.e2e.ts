/**
 * E2E: dev-proxy gRPC channel recovers promptly when its peer appears LATE.
 *
 * This is the regression test for the dev-proxy readiness bug: the proxy
 * builds its gRPC-js client once, at startup, against the daemon socket. When
 * the proxy starts BEFORE the daemon binds that socket, stock gRPC-js puts the
 * channel into an ever-growing reconnect backoff (1s -> 120s) that is
 * independent of the socket actually becoming reachable, and a unary call
 * issued while the channel is not READY fails immediately with UNAVAILABLE.
 * Callers that catch-and-log (e.g. schemas.ts's loadSchemas) then silently get
 * nothing, which is why the harness previously had to poll a real RPC to
 * decide the proxy was "ready".
 *
 * The fix lives in `packages/dev-tools/src/grpc-client.ts`: it caps the
 * reconnect backoff to a fixed ~100ms and gates every RPC on the channel
 * reaching READY. This test drives that module DIRECTLY (no proxy process, no
 * daemon binary) against a stub gRPC server that binds LATE, and asserts:
 *
 *   - a SINGLE call issued before the peer exists still succeeds (no
 *     UNAVAILABLE, no caller-side real-RPC polling), and
 *   - it resolves PROMPTLY after the peer appears — within a window the
 *     capped backoff comfortably meets but stock gRPC-js's grown backoff
 *     would not (the peer binds well after the default 1s initial backoff,
 *     so an unfixed channel would be mid a multi-second backoff at that
 *     moment and resolve seconds late, if at all).
