/**
 * E2E: daemon readiness — not-ready → degraded → recovered (#1525)
 *
 * ADR-044 decision 3 promises daemon-dependent stores "re-run their load
 * automatically when the daemon transitions from unreachable to healthy."
 * That behavior lives entirely in `daemon-status.ts` and the stores that
 * subscribe to it via `onDaemonReconnect` — a real cross-process seam, not
 * something a synchronous mock can honestly stand in for (see ADR-048's
 * rationale on the optimistic-echo regression class, which is the same
 * class of bug: the defect lives in cross-process timing a mock collapses
 * away).
 *
 * Each state below is established BY CONSTRUCTION, not by racing a real
 * process's startup timing:
 *   - "not ready" uses a socket path nothing was ever spawned against —
 *     deterministic, since there is nothing to race.
 *   - "recovered" spawns the real daemon via `DaemonTestHarness.startDeferred()`
 *     and waits on `waitUntilProxyReady()` — a real data-plane round-trip
 *     through the full HTTP -> dev-proxy -> gRPC -> daemon stack, not just
 *     the daemon's own socket. A socket-reachability probe alone is NOT
 *     sufficient here: `startDeferred()` starts the dev-proxy before the
 *     daemon binds, and the proxy's gRPC-js client — constructed once at
 *     proxy startup against a not-yet-existing socket — owns its own
 *     reconnect/backoff state independent of the daemon's actual socket
 *     becoming reachable moments later (confirmed by instrumenting a real
 *     run: the daemon's socket read as reachable while the proxy's gRPC
 *     channel was still mid-backoff, "reconnecting in 2s", so a store
 *     reload triggered right then failed silently). Waiting on the real
 *     round-trip the test is about to exercise is the only signal that
 *     means what "ready" needs to mean here — the same "reachable at one
 *     layer is not usable end-to-end" gap #1525 exists to close, this time
 *     surfacing in the test's own harness rather than the app. (Checked
 *     separately: production's tonic lazy channel does NOT have this gap —
 *     a call issued right after the daemon binds succeeds immediately, no
 *     cached backoff state. This is specific to the gRPC-js dev-proxy path.)
 *
 * `daemon-status.ts` is Tauri-event-driven in production, and this harness
 * has no Tauri runtime — so both tests bind a harness-backed
 * `DaemonStatusSource` (real UDS probes, not fabricated payloads) instead of
 * faking Tauri IPC. The only simulated piece is the transport binding,
 * which is exactly the piece whose realism doesn't matter here: it is a
 * callback wiring, not a timing seam.
