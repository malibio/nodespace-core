/**
 * Regression: `updateTaskNode()`'s failure-path catch handler unconditionally
 * called `this.nodesSet(nodeId, existingNode)` — writing this specific call's
 * OWN pre-edit snapshot (captured before ITS optimistic update was applied)
 * straight into the store on ANY write failure, OCC or not.
 *
 * Concrete failure sequence (see the issue this closes):
 * 1. Write A is executing for task node X (an in-flight, immediate-mode
 *    `updateTaskNode()` persist).
 * 2. Write B, for the same node, is submitted while A is executing —
 *    `PersistenceCoordinator.persist()`'s `isExecuting` branch collapses it
 *    into `queuedOperations`. B's own optimistic value is applied to the
 *    local store immediately (before A's RPC even settles).
 * 3. Write A's RPC rejects. Its catch handler runs `nodesSet(nodeId,
 *    existingNode)` — `existingNode` being the snapshot from BEFORE write A's
 *    own optimistic update, i.e. from before B was ever submitted. This
 *    overwrites B's optimistic value with stale content that predates it.
 * 4. Write B's real (queued, promoted) persist attempt goes on to succeed,
 *    but the damage from step 3 already discarded what the user saw.
 *
 * `updateNode()`'s sibling catch handler doesn't have this problem: it calls
 * `rollbackUpdate()`, which only rewinds bookkeeping (the pending-update
 * list, the version counter) and re-notifies with whatever the store
 * CURRENTLY holds — it never calls `nodesSet()` and never touches node
 * content. The fix makes `updateTaskNode()`'s catch handler do the same:
 * notify subscribers with the store's current value instead of force-
 * reverting to this call's own stale, pre-edit snapshot.
