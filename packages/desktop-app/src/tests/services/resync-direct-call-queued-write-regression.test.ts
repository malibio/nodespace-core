/**
 * Regression: `resyncNodeFromServer`'s DIRECT call (invoked from inside a
 * failing write's own OCC-conflict catch handler, not the queued-follow-up
 * recursion) hardcoded `hasPending: false`, so it had no way to detect a
 * second, genuinely different write that arrived and got collapsed into
 * `PersistenceCoordinator`'s `queuedOperations` while the first write was
 * still executing.
 *
 * Concrete failure sequence (see the issue this closes):
 * 1. Write A is executing for node X (an in-flight `persist()` RPC).
 * 2. Write B, for the same node, is submitted while A is executing — it
 *    collapses into the single-slot `queuedOperations` map. B's optimistic
 *    value is already applied to the local store at this point.
 * 3. Write A fails with an OCC conflict whose response does NOT embed
 *    `current_node` — `updateNode()`'s OCC handling falls back to
 *    `resyncNodeFromServer(nodeId)`, the DIRECT call.
 * 4. The node is not focused, so with `hasPending` hardcoded `false`,
 *    `decideRemoteUpdate` applies the fetched (stale, pre-B) server row,
 *    silently discarding B's still-pending optimistic value.
 *
 * Empirically confirmed (see the PR this test ships with) that a naive swap
 * to a LIVE `PersistenceCoordinator.hasPending(nodeId)` read at the decision
 * point does NOT fix this correctly: `clearQueued(nodeId)` — called
 * unconditionally by both OCC handlers immediately before either hydration
 * branch runs, to stop the FAILING write's own queued retry from firing
 * against its now-stale version — already removes B from `queuedOperations`
 * (and its `pendingOperations` placeholder) before the resync's decision
 * point is ever reached. At that point `hasPending()` would read `true`
 * anyway, but ONLY because the failing write's own `executingOperations`
 * entry hasn't cleared yet (self-referential — confirmed true even in an
 * isolated failure with nothing else queued at all, which is exactly the
 * false-positive #2066's review caught when this was first tried).
 *
 * The fix: capture `PersistenceCoordinator.isQueued(nodeId)` in the OCC
 * handler BEFORE calling `clearQueued()`, and thread that captured boolean
 * into `resyncNodeFromServer` as `directCallHadQueuedWrite` for the direct
 * call to use instead of a hardcoded `false` (or a live, self-referential
 * `hasPending()` read).
