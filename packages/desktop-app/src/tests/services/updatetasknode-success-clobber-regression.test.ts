/**
 * Regression: `updateTaskNode()`'s SUCCESS path (inside the
 * `PersistenceCoordinator.getInstance().persist(...)` closure, a few lines
 * above the OCC catch handler) used to read `this.nodes.get(nodeId)` at the
 * moment this specific write's RPC resolved and mutate it in place via
 * `Object.assign(localNode, { status, priority, dueDate, assignee,
 * startedAt, completedAt })` — unconditionally, using ALL of this write's
 * own response fields, not just the ones it actually asked to change.
 *
 * Concrete failure sequence (verified against the pre-fix code before this
 * fix was applied — see the issue this closes):
 * 1. Write A changes one task field (e.g. priority) for node X. Its
 *    optimistic apply lands, then its persist() RPC is sent and is still in
 *    flight.
 * 2. Write B, for the SAME node, changes a DIFFERENT field (e.g. status)
 *    while A is still executing. `PersistenceCoordinator.persist()`'s
 *    `isExecuting` branch collapses B into `queuedOperations` (a real RPC
 *    for B is not sent yet — only one write executes per node at a time).
 *    B's own optimistic update (built from A's already-optimistic node) DOES
 *    land in the store immediately, synchronously, at call time.
 * 3. Write A's RPC resolves successfully. Its response reflects the
 *    server's view as of A's OWN request — which never included B's change,
 *    since B hasn't been sent yet.
 * 4. A's success handler read `this.nodes.get(nodeId)` — which is now B's
 *    optimistic object, not A's own — and unconditionally `Object.assign`ed
 *    ALL of A's response's type-specific fields onto it. This included
 *    fields A never changed (e.g. `status`), stamped with A's stale pre-B
 *    value, clobbering B's optimistic edit before B's own write had even
 *    been attempted.
 *
 * Fixed by limiting the patch applied from each write's response to only
 * the fields THAT write's own request actually asked to change (mirroring
 * what `localChanges` already does for the optimistic apply at the top of
 * `updateTaskNode()`). A field a write didn't touch is left exactly as the
 * store currently has it, however it got there.
