/**
 * Regression for the SAME-field concurrent-write race left open after the
 * fix in `updatetasknode-success-clobber-regression.test.ts` (which only
 * closed the DIFFERENT-field case).
 *
 * Concrete failure sequence this test reproduces (pre-fix):
 * 1. Write A changes `status` for node X. Its optimistic apply lands, then
 *    its persist() RPC is sent and is still in flight.
 * 2. Write B, for the SAME node, ALSO changes `status` (a different value)
 *    while A is still executing. `PersistenceCoordinator.persist()`'s
 *    `isExecuting` branch collapses B into `queuedOperations` — a real RPC
 *    for B is not sent yet. B's own optimistic `status` DOES land in the
 *    store immediately, synchronously, at call time, overwriting A's
 *    optimistic value.
 * 3. Write A's RPC resolves successfully. Its response's `status` reflects
 *    the server's view as of A's OWN request — which never included B's
 *    change, since B hasn't been sent yet.
 * 4. Even with the DIFFERENT-field fix in place, A's success handler still
 *    applies `status` from its own response, because A's own `update` DID
 *    specify `status` — field-scoping alone can't tell that a NEWER write
 *    for that exact same field has since landed. This transiently reverts
 *    the store to A's stale status, clobbering B's optimistic value, until
 *    B's own real (queued, promoted) write later resolves and re-applies
 *    the correct final value.
 *
 * This is self-correcting (B's own write always resolves the value
 * eventually) but produces a real, if brief, wrong-value window. Fixed by
 * a per-node-per-field write-sequence counter (`bumpTaskFieldSeq` /
 * `getTaskFieldSeq`): each write captures the sequence number for every
 * field it touches at optimistic-apply time, and only applies that field
 * from its own response if the field's sequence hasn't moved on since —
 * i.e. no newer same-field write raced in ahead of this write's response.
