<!--
  KanbanView - Board view for QueryNodeViewer

  Groups results into columns by the values of a selected enum field (the only
  eligible group-by kind — enum values give both the column set and their labels).
  Cards show the node title and read from sharedNodeStore, so a change made in
  another pane (or by a drag here) moves the card reactively. Dragging a card to
  another column — or choosing a column from the card's keyboard-accessible
  "Move to" control — writes that column's value onto the node. Nodes with no
  value land in an "Unassigned" column.

  Each column renders at most a capped batch of cards (matching List/Table's
  PAGE_SIZE) rather than every matching node — a column with thousands of
  cards would otherwise render thousands of card-plus-full-options-<select>
  pairs regardless of scroll position. A "+N more" control grows that
  column's *set* of revealed cards by one more batch; revealing is tracked by
  node id, not by position, so a card already on screen can't vanish because
  some other card's bucket membership changed elsewhere in the result order
  (slicing by position alone can't make that guarantee — inserting a card
  ahead of an already-shown one would push the shown one past a plain
  positional cutoff). True virtualization (windowing) was considered and
  rejected here: this view's drag source is the rendered DOM node itself
  (native HTML5 drag-and-drop), and a windowed list unmounts off-screen rows —
  a card scrolled out of the window mid-drag would be destroyed out from
  under its own drag operation.
