<!--
  RelationshipViewerModal — browse and edit a node's typed relationships.

  ## Two panes, not stacked tables

  LEFT is a rail of the relationships this node actually HAS, one row each with
  its edge count. RIGHT is every edge of the selected relationship. Before this,
  each populated relationship rendered its own full-width table stacked
  vertically, so a node with six of them was six tables and a scrollbar: the
  panel's height tracked the node's connectivity. The rail stays the same size
  whatever that connectivity is.

  Two panes rather than three because expansion does the third pane's job in
  place: a row expands to its own edge properties, so properties stay one click
  away and a single-target relationship needs no special case — it simply shows
  its one edge.

  ## Only established relationships appear

  The rail lists what EXISTS. A relationship the schema declares but the node
  has no edge for does not appear, not even as a `0` row — placeholder rows in a
  rail are the same disease as empty sections, rotated ninety degrees. Declared
  relationships surface only when the user asks, via `+ Add`.

  ## `+ Add` marks the ownership boundary

  Rail order is: relationships this node OWNS, then `+ Add`, then a divider,
  then INCOMING · READ-ONLY. The control's position tells the user what they can
  create, so nothing has to carry that rule as a badge — and the absent controls
  in the detail pane are what actually hold it.

  ## Incoming relationships are the same edge from the other end

  An inbound relationship is not a second relationship. It is the SAME physical
  row in the `relationship` table, whose source is the other node — which is
  where it is declared, and therefore where it is owned. It shows here with the
  SAME values, read-only. Editing means opening the owning node, which the
  target link does.

  This is the authority model, not a UI convenience: a `person` viewing
  `has_access_to → Design Docs` sees `access: Owner` and must not change it,
  because access is granted from the collection's panel.

  ## Nothing is "saved"

  Edits persist on change, as node edits do everywhere else in the app. There is
  no Save button; adding one would reintroduce a pattern the codebase has moved
  past.

   * Rail rows follow DESIGN.md's Sidebar convention: `active-nav-background`
   * when active, `hover-background` on hover. Both are read through
   * `hsl(var(...))` rather than a Tailwind class because neither token is
   * mapped in the Tailwind config — the navigation sidebar reads them the same
   * way, so this matches the one existing consumer rather than inventing a
   * second access path.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT `bg-accent`: in this palette `--accent` is a saturated
   * teal, and DESIGN.md reserves teal for interactive affordances while the
   * codebase uses `bg-accent` for TRANSIENT highlight (dropdown focus,
   * autocomplete selection). A rail selection is persistent structural state,
   * which is what `active-nav-background` exists for.
