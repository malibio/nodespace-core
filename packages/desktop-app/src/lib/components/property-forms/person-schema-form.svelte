<!--
  PersonSchemaForm - Property form for person nodes

  Provides direct editing of first_name/last_name/email fields stored in
  properties.person.{first_name,last_name,email}. Display identity (the
  inline outline row and node title) is composed by the person schema's
  title_template ("{first_name} {last_name}") — not synced into content
  here; person nodes are read-only inline, like other title_template-driven
  types (see resolveTitleOrContent / node-row.svelte).

  Email carries a store-aware `unique` schema rule (ADR-065, case-insensitive,
  ignores empty): on blur, a colliding value surfaces a dismissible "a person
  with this email already exists" suggestion — adopt-existing (navigate to the
  match) or keep-as-new (dismiss, keep editing this node). This is
  suggest-don't-block by design: the field save above is never gated on the
  lookup, and create-anyway always remains possible.

  Convergence duplicate indicator (ADR-065 §4): a duplicate that
  slips past the creation-time suggestion above (offline write, sync
  convergence) gets detected out-of-band and stamped onto BOTH colliding
  nodes as `properties.person._possible_duplicate`. When that marker is set,
  a small "Possible duplicate" badge appears; clicking it re-runs the exact
  same lookup and reuses the exact same suggestion UI as the blur-triggered
  check above — no separate merge/resolution machinery.
