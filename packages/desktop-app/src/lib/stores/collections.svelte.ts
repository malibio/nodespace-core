/**
 * Collections Store
 *
 * Manages the state for the Collections browser in the navigation sidebar.
 * Collections are AI-managed groupings of related nodes that span across the hierarchy.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * - Collections are flat (globally unique names, no parent-child hierarchy)
 * - Paths like "hr:policy:vacation" are navigation conventions, not structure
 * - Nodes can belong to multiple collections (many-to-many via member_of edges)
 *
 * ## Data Flow
 *
 * 1. `collectionsData` - Reactive store with all collections from backend
 * 2. `collectionsState` - UI state (selection, sub-panel, expanded items)
 * 3. Computed getters for selected collection and its members
 *
 * Svelte 5 rune store (ADR-049): state lives on the classes as `$state`;
 * `collectionsTree` / `selectedCollection` / `selectedCollectionMembers` are
 * computed getters, not `derived` stores.
