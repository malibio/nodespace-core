 * AI Chats Store

 * Mirrors `collections.svelte.ts`'s data-store shape (a `load*` method called
 * from the sidebar's `onMount`, reactive `$state`), simplified — unlike
 * collections there is no hide-empty filter to work around, so a newly
 * created chat is simply prepended to the loaded list rather than needing an
 * optimistic-insert/reconcile dance.

 * an arbitrary (effectively insertion-order) subset with no ORDER BY clause,
 * and sorting that subset afterward could not recover chats the LIMIT had
 * already excluded, silently hiding genuinely-recent ones. Fetching
 * everything and slicing after the sort mirrors `collectionsData.loadCollections()`,
 * which also fetches its full list with no limit. The list itself scrolls
