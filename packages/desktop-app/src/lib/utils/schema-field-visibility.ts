/**
 * Single shared predicate for "should this schema field be shown to a user?".
 *
 * `protection: 'system'` marks a field the backend owns end to end — a
 * convergence marker like person's `_possible_duplicate`, an ai-chat session
 * bookkeeping field like `capture:transcript`. Nothing a user types, and on a
 * local-only install several of them are empty by construction. They must not
 * render as an editable control, and equally must not render as a table column
 * that can never be filled.
 *
 * Every UI surface that decides whether to *render* a field should filter
 * through this, so the detail form and the table view cannot drift apart on
 * what "visible" means. Surfaces that use `fields` for something other than
 * rendering — offering query filter properties, say — make their own call.
