 *
 * Limitations:
 * - Can discard valid local changes if remote update is newer
 * - No field-level merging
 * - Not ideal for high-frequency concurrent editing

 * Field-Level Merge Resolver (Future - Phase 2+)

 * Intelligent strategy: Merge non-conflicting field changes

 *
 * Example:
 *   Local:  { content: "A", properties: { color: "red" } }
 *   Remote: { content: "B", properties: { size: "large" } }
 *   Merged: { content: ?, properties: { color: "red", size: "large" } }
