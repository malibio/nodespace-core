/**
 * SchemaFormLoader — lazy-loads type-specific and generic schema forms for the viewed node.

 * Type-specific forms (e.g. TaskSchemaForm) come from the plugin registry. Any node type
 * with no registered form — user-defined schema types and core types alike — falls back to
 * a generic schema form driven by the node's SchemaNode definition, fetched from the backend.
 *
 * State lives here as `$state` so the viewer re-renders when a form or schema resolves.
 * One instance per viewer component; loading is event-driven (the viewer calls the load
 * methods when the viewed node changes), not `$effect`-driven.
