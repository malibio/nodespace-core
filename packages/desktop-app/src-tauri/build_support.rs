//! Shared between `build.rs` (which calls this for real, immediately before
//! `tauri_build::build()`) and `nodespace-app-test-support`, which re-exports
//! `sync_stale_sidecar` purely so `tests/sidecar_staging_sync_test.rs` can
//! exercise the real algorithm against synthetic trees — no duplicated
//! copy.
//!
//! Pulled into each crate root via `mod build_support;` / `#[path = ...]
//! mod build_support;` rather than published as its own workspace crate:
//! `nodespace-app-test-support` already depends on `nodespace-app` (its
//! `lib.rs`), so it cannot also be a `[build-dependencies]` of
//! `nodespace-app` — that would be a build-dependency cycle back onto the
//! same package. A shared source file sidesteps the cycle entirely; no
//! crate boundary, no duplication.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! `tauri-build`'s own handling of `bundle.externalBin` (`copy_binaries` in
//! `tauri-build-2.6.2/src/lib.rs`) copies each configured sidecar —
//! `src-tauri/binaries/<bin>-<target-triple>` — onto `target/<profile>/<bin>`
//! (the bare cargo build output name, stripped of its triple suffix) every
//! time `nodespace-app`'s build script runs. That copy is unconditional: it
//! `fs::remove_file`s whatever is already at the destination and overwrites
//! it, with no mtime or freshness check of any kind.
//!
//! Because `target/<profile>/` is the *whole workspace's* shared Cargo
//! output directory, `target/<profile>/nodespaced` is also exactly where
//! `cargo build --bin nodespaced` puts the daemon binary from an entirely
//! unrelated crate (`nodespace-daemon`). If the staged sidecar
//! (`src-tauri/binaries/nodespaced-<triple>`) is stale — e.g. it was last
//! refreshed via `bun run build:sidecars` days ago and never rebuilt since —
//! then simply building `nodespace-app` (a plain `cargo build -p
//! nodespace-app`, `cargo test -p nodespace-app`, or anything that reruns
//! its build script) silently clobbers a genuinely fresh
//! `target/<profile>/nodespaced` with those old bytes. This is the reverse
//! of the direction developers expect data to flow (stage the sidecar FROM
//! the build output, not the other way around), which is what makes it so
//! confusing to diagnose — see `daemon_binary_freshness` in
//! `nodespace-app-test-support`, which detects the resulting staleness but
//! cannot prevent it, since by the time a test runs the clobber has already
//! happened.
//!
//! [`sync_stale_sidecar`] closes that gap by running immediately before
//! `tauri_build::build()`, inside the same build script invocation: whichever
//! of the two files (`target/<profile>/<bin>` or the staged sidecar) is
//! newer wins and gets copied onto the other. When the just-built workspace
//! binary is newer, the stale sidecar is refreshed from it *before*
//! `tauri-build` gets a chance to copy the old sidecar back — so
//! `tauri-build`'s own unconditional copy becomes a same-bytes no-op instead
//! of a regression. When the sidecar happens to be newer (e.g. a
//! cross-compiled or hand-staged release binary with no corresponding local
//! `target/<profile>/` build), nothing is touched and `tauri-build` proceeds
//! exactly as it always has.
