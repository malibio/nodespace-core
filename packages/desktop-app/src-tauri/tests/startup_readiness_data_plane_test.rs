//! ADR-048 priority flow 5 — startup readiness, extended to the DATA PLANE.
//!
//! `daemon_readiness_test.rs` already covers the readiness SIGNAL
//! (`check_daemon_status` / `wait_for_daemon` agreeing on not_running vs.
//! healthy for a real daemon). What it does not cover is what actually
//! happens on the command layer during the not-ready window: does a data
//! command fail cleanly (a real, catchable error) rather than hanging or
//! panicking, and does the exact same command succeed immediately once the
//! daemon is healthy — using the SAME `GrpcClient`, so this also proves the
//! lazy-connect story (a client constructed before the daemon is reachable
//! recovers on its own, with no explicit reconnect step) that the frontend
//! actually relies on at app startup.
//!
//! "Degraded state" as a Svelte-visible concept (`daemonStatus.unreachable`,
//! store self-healing on reconnect) is ADR-044's contract and already has
//! real, thorough e2e coverage in
//! `src/tests/e2e/daemon-readiness.e2e.ts` — deliberately not duplicated
//! here. There is no separate Rust/daemon-side "degraded" enum variant
//! (confirmed: `DaemonStatus` is `Healthy` / `Starting` / `NotRunning`);
//! "degraded" is a frontend-store concept built on top of that signal.
