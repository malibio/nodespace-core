//! Guards the ADR-048 suite against the failure mode that is hardest to
//! diagnose from inside it: running a real `nodespaced` that is not a build of
//! this checkout.
//!
//! An out-of-date daemon still speaks the current gRPC surface, so every RPC in
//! these tests succeeds and only the daemon's *behaviour* differs. That
//! surfaced once as `ai_chat_send_to_idle_test` timing out after 300s with the
//! chat node back at `status: "idle"` and no assistant reply — the pre-existing
//! silent-idle-on-inference-failure behaviour of an old daemon, indistinguishable
//! from a regression in whatever change was being pushed. Nothing in the repo
//! keeps either candidate binary (the hand-staged `src-tauri/binaries/` sidecar,
//! or `target/debug/nodespaced`) in sync with the source tree, and cargo's own
//! mtime-based freshness check treats artifacts copied in from another checkout
//! as up to date, so the fixture checks it directly.
//!
//! These cases drive `daemon_binary_freshness` against synthetic trees rather
//! than the real workspace: the real answer depends on when the machine last
//! built, which is exactly the thing under test.
