//! Integration test for #1525 — proves the daemon-readiness contract holds
//! against a REAL headless `nodespaced`, not a mock: a socket nothing is
//! listening on reports NotRunning, a real daemon's bind is observed as
//! Healthy once `wait_for_daemon` catches up to it, and both the raw
//! reachability probe (`check_daemon_socket`/`wait_for_daemon`) and
//! `daemon_status_body` (the body of the `check_daemon_status` Tauri
//! command) agree on that transition.
//!
//! Each state is established BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by racing a real
//! process's startup timing: "not ready" tests use a socket path nothing was
//! ever spawned for (deterministic — there is nothing to race), and
//! "recovered" tests wait on the real daemon via `wait_for_daemon` (timing-
//! tolerant by design) rather than asserting an intermediate NotRunning read
//! against it. A real daemon here binds its socket in well under 100ms on a
//! warm local machine — far faster than ADR-044's ~9s cold-start figure for
//! a heavier path — so asserting "not yet bound" against a just-spawned real
//! process would only pass when the test wins that race, which is a
//! coverage lottery, not a behavior guarantee.
//!
//! `check_daemon_status` itself takes no injected `State`/`AppHandle` — its
//! logic is exercised here via `daemon_status_body`, factored out so it can
//! be `pub` without colliding with the hidden items `#[tauri::command]`
//! generates (see the comment on `daemon_status_body` in `lib.rs`). No
//! Tauri mock runtime is needed to exercise it for real.
