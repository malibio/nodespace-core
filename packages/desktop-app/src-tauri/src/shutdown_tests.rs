//! Regression coverage for the `CloseRequested`-veto shutdown race: Tauri
//! fires `WindowEvent::CloseRequested` the instant the OS asks to close a
//! window — before the frontend's `onCloseRequested` veto (which flushes
//! pending writes first) has had any chance to run. `graceful_shutdown` must
//! never be driven from that event, only from `ExitRequested`/`Exit`, which
//! Tauri can't reach until the window has actually been destroyed. See
//! `handle_run_event`'s doc comment in `lib.rs` for the full reasoning.
//!
//! These use `tauri::test`'s `MockRuntime` (a real Tauri event bus and
//! window lifecycle, no webview/display) rather than plain unit tests,
//! because the bug this covers lived in *which* `RunEvent` variant triggers
//! shutdown — a mapping that only exists inside Tauri's actual window-close
//! machinery. Most of the types involved (`CloseRequestApi`, `ExitRequestApi`)
//! have no public constructor a hand-built `RunEvent` could stand in for
//! (confirmed against the `tauri` 2.11 source), so exercising the real
//! dispatch is the only faithful way to test the routing.
