//! First-launch skill installer.
//!
//! Runs the bundled `packages/skill` installer to copy SKILL.md and agent
//! shims into detected agents' directories. Persists completion state to
//! `~/.nodespace/setup.json` so subsequent launches are no-ops once
//! installation succeeds.
//!
//! # Two ways to run the installer
//!
//! Preferred: the compiled standalone binary (`bun build --compile packages/
//! skill/src/install.ts`, staged as the `nodespace-skill-installer`
//! `externalBin` sidecar — see `resolve_compiled_installer_path`). No
//! external runtime needed at all; a packaged app's end user has no reason
//! to have `bun` or `node` installed, so this is what a real release build
//! actually uses.
//!
//! Fallback: the plain JS build (`dist/install.js`, executed via `bun` or
//! `node` — never `npx`/`npm`, see [`INSTALLER_RUNTIMES`]) when the compiled
//! binary isn't available — a dev/source checkout that hasn't run the
//! compile step, or a platform this hasn't been wired up for yet. See
//! `resolve_installer_path`.
//!
//! Also verifies that the `nodespace` CLI is resolvable on $PATH and emits a
//! warning if not (the skill is useless until the CLI is installed).
//!
//! # Failure surfacing
//!
//! A genuine install failure is logged at `WARN`; subsequent launches with
//! the same still-unresolved failure log at `DEBUG` only (retries keep
//! happening — the environment may since have been fixed, e.g. `bun` got
//! installed — but the log doesn't repeat the warning every launch). A
//! later success clears the persisted failure flag.
//!
//! [`SkillSetupResult::failure_is_new`] tells a caller whether *this*
//! failure is the first one seen (vs. a repeat of an already-known one).
//! Only the fire-and-forget startup call site (`lib.rs`) acts on it — it has
//! no other way to reach the user, so it pushes a one-time `skill:install-failed`
//! event to the frontend when `failure_is_new` is true. The onboarding/manual
//! retry commands (`configure_skill`, `install_skill`) don't need this: their
//! caller is a UI action already awaiting the command's return value, so
//! `error` on the returned `SkillSetupResult` is all they need — emitting the
//! event there too would show the same failure twice (once inline, once as a
//! toast).
//!
//! # Coexistence with the skill-triggered CLI/GUI install path
//!
//! `nodespace-website`'s `install.sh` (the `curl -fsSL https://nodespace.ai/
//! install.sh | sh` one-liner, also invoked non-interactively via `--no-gui`
//! from the skill's own failure-recovery guidance) installs the `nodespace`/
//! `nodespaced` **binaries** — it never touches SKILL.md or an agent's skill
//! directory, so it cannot race or clobber what this module installs. The
//! two installers share exactly one piece of state end to end:
//! `~/.nodespace/setup.json`'s `skill_installed` flag, read by
//! [`install_skill`]'s idempotency guard above. `install.sh` does not write
//! this file, so a machine that got its CLI via `install.sh` and later
//! launches the GUI for the first time still gets exactly one real skill
//! install here — not a second, silent one racing a manual edit the user
//! made to their installed SKILL.md.
//!
//! If a future change has `install.sh`'s skill-triggered entry point also
//! install skill files (today it does not), it must set `skill_installed:
//! true` in this same file/schema on success so this module's early-return
//! guard in [`install_skill`] correctly no-ops instead of re-running the
//! bundled installer over a skill the user already set up manually.
