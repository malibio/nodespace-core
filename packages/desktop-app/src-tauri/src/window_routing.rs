//! Window <-> database routing: which open window an emitted event reaches.
//!
//! A window opened deliberately for a specific, already-known database
//! (any future "open in a new window" trigger) gets that database's id as
//! its literal Tauri window label — straightforward, since the id is known
//! before the window is built. The one exception is the app's bootstrap
//! window: at a cold launch with no `--database` pick (the common case —
//! Dock/Spotlight, not the tray's per-database submenu), which database it
//! will show is resolved *asynchronously* by the frontend (a remembered
//! selection in `localStorage`, or the registry default fetched over gRPC
//! once the daemon answers) — nothing on the Rust side can know it
//! synchronously at window-creation time, before the webview has even
//! loaded. That window keeps its static `tauri.conf.json` label ("main") but
//! is tracked here exactly like any other window once the frontend calls
//! [`pin_window_database`] to declare which database it settled on — so
//! routing correctness never actually depends on the literal label string,
//! only on this registry being kept current.
//!
//! [`WindowDatabaseRegistry`] is the live label -> database id map every
//! routing decision below reads. [`emit_routed`] replaces every previous
//! `app.get_webview_window("main")` + `.emit(...)` call (and the
//! database-scoped broadcasts in `watcher.rs`, which reached every open
//! window regardless of which database they belonged to): an event carrying
//! a non-empty `database_id` reaches only the window(s) currently pinned to
//! that database; an event with no id (or the daemon's empty-string
//! "not database-scoped" convention) reaches the focused window, falling
//! back to a deterministic default when nothing is focused — the common case
//! for a moment at startup, before the OS has assigned focus to the
//! just-created window.
