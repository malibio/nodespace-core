/**
 * gRPC-js client factory for the Bun dev-proxy (browser mode).
 *
 * This module owns the single seam where the dev-proxy talks to nodespaced
 * over a Unix-domain socket. It exists as its own module (rather than inline
 * in dev-proxy.ts) so the not-ready -> recovered behavior below can be
 * regression-tested against a stub gRPC server without spawning the whole
 * proxy or the real daemon.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this module reshapes gRPC-js's reconnect behavior
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The dev-proxy constructs its gRPC-js client ONCE, at startup, against the
 * daemon socket. When the proxy starts BEFORE the daemon binds that socket
 * (which the e2e readiness harness does deliberately), the gRPC-js channel's
 * subchannel enters TRANSIENT_FAILURE and starts its OWN reconnect backoff —
 * a timer completely independent of the daemon socket actually becoming
 * reachable moments later. Two properties of stock gRPC-js make that a real
 * bug for the dev path:
 *
 *   1. The reconnect backoff GROWS unboundedly while the peer is down
 *      (grpc-js defaults: 1s initial, x1.6 each attempt, up to 120s). By the
 *      time the daemon binds, the channel may be sitting out a multi-second
 *      backoff before it even retries the transport — so a raw socket probe
 *      can report the daemon up while the channel is still mid-backoff.
 *      `getConnectivityState(true)` / `client.waitForReady()` / an LB
 *      `resetBackoff()` do NOT cut this short: in grpc-js the backoff lives on
 *      the subchannel, the pick-first balancer's `resetBackoff` is a no-op,
 *      and `startConnecting()` on a TRANSIENT_FAILURE subchannel only marks
 *      "reconnect once the current timer ends" — it does not restart the
 *      timer. The only robust lever the public API exposes is bounding the
 *      backoff via channel options, which we do here: a fixed ~100ms retry
 *      interval means the channel re-probes the transport ~10x/second and
 *      recovers within ~100ms of the socket appearing, regardless of how long
 *      the daemon was down.
 *
 *   2. A unary call issued while the channel is NOT READY fails IMMEDIATELY
 *      with UNAVAILABLE by default (gRPC "wait for ready" is off by default),
 *      so callers that catch-and-log (e.g. loadSchemas) silently get nothing.
 *      `call`/`agentCall`/`agentStream` gate every RPC on
 *      `client.waitForReady(deadline)` first,
 *      so the call is issued only once the channel has actually reached READY.
 *      Combined with (1), that resolves within ~100ms of the daemon binding.
 *
 * The production Tauri path (Rust/tonic `connect_with_connector_lazy`) has no
 * equivalent cached-backoff state — tonic retries the connector fresh per
 * call — so this shaping is dev-proxy-specific and does not exist there.

/**
 * Channel options for the long-lived `WatchNodes` stream.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the watch stream needs a connection of its own
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Parking a long-lived server-streaming call on the HTTP/2 connection the
 * unary RPCs share wedges that connection under Bun: after roughly 64 KiB of
 * response data has arrived, every later RPC on it hangs forever. The channel
 * still reports READY and the daemon sits idle — the requests never reach it.
 *
 * This is a Bun defect, not HTTP/2 semantics. The same grpc-js, daemon, socket
 * and channel options, varying ONLY the runtime, with a `WatchNodes` stream
 * open on the shared channel:
 *
 *   Bun 1.2.16     3/40 calls, 62,856 bytes, then wedged
 *   Node v26.8.1   40/40 calls, 838,080 bytes, clean
 *
 * Node never wedges, so grpc-js's own flow-control handling is not at fault.
 * The 62,856-byte stopping point sits just under HTTP/2's default 65,535-byte
 * connection window, which is why byte volume rather than call count decides
 * when it hits: `GetAllSchemas` (~21 KB) wedged on the 4th call, while
 * `GetDaemonVersion` (~19 bytes) ran 400/400. Whether Bun fails to emit its own
 * WINDOW_UPDATEs or mishandles hyper's, we did not determine — an in-process
 * grpc-js stub server does NOT reproduce the wedge, only the real tonic/hyper
 * daemon does, so something the two servers do differently is also involved.
 *
 * Widening the window from the client does not help. gRPC-js exposes
 * `grpc-node.flow_control_window` and calls `session.setLocalWindowSize()` on
 * `remoteSettings` (`@grpc/grpc-js/build/src/transport.js`); Bun provides that
 * method and it does not throw, but raising the window to 16 MiB left the wedge
 * at the same 3 calls and the same byte count. So the stream has to stop
 * sharing the connection.
 *
 * `grpc.use_local_subchannel_pool` is gRPC-js's supported way to ask for that.
 * `internal-channel.js` passes it to `getSubchannelPool`, which returns a fresh
 * `SubchannelPool` instead of the process-global one, so this client can never
 * be pooled onto the connection the unary clients share — separation by
 * construction rather than by incidentally-unequal options. Verified: 200/200
 * unary calls and 4.19 MB through the proxy, versus 3 before.
 *
 * Two independent barriers actually keep the connections apart, which is worth
 * knowing before editing this object. Beyond the pool selection above, reuse
 * inside a shared pool also requires `channelOptionsEqual` (`subchannel-pool.js`
 * -> `channel-options.js`), an exact key-and-value comparison that this extra
 * key already defeats. Deleting the key collapses both at once and silently
 * restores a bug whose symptom is a 30s hang with no error — so keep it here
 * rather than folding it into DEV_PROXY_CHANNEL_OPTIONS, and let
 * `watch-stream-isolation.e2e.ts` be the thing that catches the mistake.
 *
 * Switching the proxy to Node would also avoid the defect, but that trades a
 * one-line channel option for a runtime split against this repo's Bun-only
 * standard, and would change how the dev-proxy runs for developers rather than
 * only in tests. The production Tauri path (Rust/tonic on both ends, no Bun) is
 * unaffected either way, so this split stays dev-proxy-specific.
