/// has several unary RPCs (`QueryNodesSimple`, `GetRoots`, `GetChildren`,
/// `GetCollectionMembers`, `ExportMarkdown`, …) whose response carries every
/// matching node's full record in one message. A real database of a few tens
/// of megabytes already produces a response of several megabytes, so the
/// default limit turns an ordinary read into an `OutOfRange` transport error.
///
/// The transport here is a local Unix socket / Named Pipe between processes
/// owned by the same user, and the daemon already holds the same records in
/// memory to build the response — so the limit exists to bound memory, not to
/// defend a trust boundary. This value leaves roughly an order of magnitude of
/// headroom over the largest response observed from a real database while
/// still refusing a runaway allocation.

/// A response large enough to approach this ceiling means the RPC needs a
/// bounded/paged contract, not a larger number here.
