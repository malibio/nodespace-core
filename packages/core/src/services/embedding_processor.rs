//! Background Embedding Processor
//!
//! Provides event-driven background processing of stale root-aggregate embeddings:
//! - Purely event-driven: only wakes when nodes change
//! - Per-root debounce: each root waits 30s after last change before embedding
//! - Processes embeddings that have passed their debounce window
//! - Graceful shutdown support
//!
//! ## Event-Driven Model with Per-Root Debounce
//!
//! The processor is purely event-driven with smart debounce scheduling:
//! 1. Woken by triggers when nodes change (marks stale, resets debounce timer)
//! 2. When woken, processes any embeddings that have passed their debounce window
//! 3. If stale embeddings exist but haven't passed debounce, schedules a delayed wake
//! 4. Zero CPU overhead when idle - no polling
//!
//! This ensures:
//! - Rapid edits don't trigger constant re-embedding (debounce per root)
//! - Bulk imports wait until complete before embedding (all children created)
//! - Independent documents don't block each other (per-root timers)
//! - No wasted cycles polling when there's no work
//!
//! ## Root-Aggregate Model
//!
//! This processor works with the root-aggregate embedding model where:
//! - Only root nodes (no parent) of embeddable types get embedded
//! - Embeddings are stored in the `embedding` table, not on nodes
//! - The `stale` flag tracks which embeddings need regeneration
//! - The `modified_at` field tracks when embedding was marked stale (for debounce)
