/// Graph Editing) are deliberately generic across every non-core type, so
/// there is no single static type list to give them without contradicting
/// their purpose. This mechanism narrows per query instead, so a generic
/// skill still contributes a scoped `schema_metadata` when the query itself
/// determines the type.

/// happens to also be a common word or phrase (e.g. a schema literally
/// named `Note`), narrowing to a confidently WRONG type rather than the old
/// broad-but-safe top-N fallback.
///
/// core#2158 measured this rather than guessing at it (see
/// `schema_named_in_query_measured_zero_false_positives_on_precedent_schema_names`
/// and `schema_named_in_query_confirmed_false_positive_class_common_word_schema_names`
/// below for the corpora and pinned results):
///
/// - Every non-core schema name with actual precedent in this codebase
///   (`ticket`, `adr`, `release`, `release_plan`, `venue`, `invoice`,
///   `equipment` — drawn from `packages/agent/goldens/*.toml`, this
///   module's own tests, and the `Venue`/`Invoice` examples in ADR-063 and
///   `schema-management.md`) measures a **0% false-positive rate** against
///   a 52-query corpus spanning both this project's real dev-workflow
///   queries and everyday PKM-assistant chatter. For domain-specific names,
///   the risk is not merely low, it did not reproduce at all.
/// - It is NOT low for schema names that are themselves common English
///   words — plausible names in NodeSpace's own domain, a personal
///   knowledge tool rather than only a dev tracker (`Note`, `Meeting`,
///   `Idea`, `Goal`, `Item`, `Event`, ...). That class measures a real,
///   reproducible **2.2% false-positive rate** (33/1508 pairs over 29 such
///   names), including the review's own worked example verbatim: a schema
///   named `Note` narrows on "please note that the meeting moved to 3pm".
/// - No lightweight guard was added despite that, because none survives
///   the same measurement: every one of those 29 risky words is ALSO the
///   exact word a genuine positive query for that same type would use (a
///   `Log` schema is found by "add a log for today's workout" using the
///   identical token that falsely matches "log me out of this session"). A
///   stopword list or length floor removes the false positives and the true
///   positives together — there is no lexical signal in `mentions_phrase`'s
///   input that tells them apart, so filtering here would just trade one
///   failure mode for a different, equally silent one (a real `Note` schema
///   query silently losing its narrowing, indistinguishable from one that
///   never had it).
///
/// Left as-is rather than guarded, because the failure mode is bounded even
/// in the worst case: this only affects one prompt-assist channel's
/// precision (`schema_metadata`, which shapes a write tool's declared
/// `field_values` sub-schema). That sub-schema is never closed —
/// `with_declared_field_values` (`packages/agent/src/local_agent/tools.rs`)
/// sets no `additionalProperties: false`, and `field_values`'s own
/// description explicitly instructs the model to add any key the user
/// supplied that the declared list doesn't cover — so a wrong narrow
/// degrades to "no typed hint for the correct type's fields on this turn,
/// plus some irrelevant ones," never to "the model cannot express the
/// correct write." Write validation still enforces the real schema at the
