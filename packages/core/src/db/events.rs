//! Domain Events for SurrealStore
//!
//! This module defines the domain events emitted by SurrealStore when data changes.
//! These events follow the observer pattern, allowing other parts of the system
//! (like the Tauri layer) to subscribe to data changes without coupling to the
//! database layer implementation.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Events are emitted using tokio's broadcast channel, allowing multiple subscribers
//! to receive notifications asynchronously.
//!
//! # Event Flow
//!
//! 1. SurrealStore performs a data operation (create, update, delete)
//! 2. Domain event is emitted via broadcast channel
//! 3. All subscribers receive the event asynchronously
//! 4. LiveQueryService (Tauri layer) listens to events and forwards to frontend
