//! The store's SQLite connections — deliberately sealed inside this module.
//!
//! Rust privacy is per-module and *descends*: a private field of `SqliteStore`
//! is still reachable from `sqlite_store::nodes`, `::relationships`,
//! `::embeddings` and `::search`, because those are child modules of the module
//! that declares it. So holding the raw `libsql::Database` as a private field
//! of `SqliteStore` would NOT stop a sibling module from writing
//! `self.database.connect()?.execute(…)` and bypassing the read/write
//! discipline entirely — silently reintroducing exactly the bug this design
//! exists to prevent, with no compiler error.
//!
//! Putting the raw handles here fixes that. `sqlite_store` and its children are
//! not descendants of `sqlite_store::connections`, so the fields below are
//! genuinely unreachable from them: the only ways to obtain a connection are
//! [`Connections::write`] and [`Connections::read`].
//!
//! What is enforced, precisely:
//! - a connection cannot be *minted* outside this module;
//! - a mutating statement cannot be reached through the read path, because
//!   [`ReadConn`] exposes `query` and nothing else.
//!
//! What is not, and cannot be without wrapping libsql's whole surface: a
//! `WriteGuard` derefs to a real `libsql::Connection`, so code that has already
//! been *handed* one can clone it and keep it past the guard. That is visible
//! and deliberate at its one call site (a test that needs a raw held
//! `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`), not something a caller does by accident.
//!
//! Also not enforced by the type system: a [`ReadRows`] cursor owns its
//! connection until it drops, so a store method that calls another store method
//! while its own cursor is still live pins two connections where one would do.
//! Nothing makes that a compile error — the cursor is simply still in scope.
//! [`ReaderGauge`] makes it *observable* instead, so a test can assert the
//! bound a call path actually needs rather than leaving the rule to review.
