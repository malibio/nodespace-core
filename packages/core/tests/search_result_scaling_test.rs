//! Search cost must be dominated by a fixed per-call component, not by the
//! number of results returned.
//!
//! Several layers of the search path used to do one query per result, executed
//! serially: `search_embeddings` hydrated every surviving candidate with its own
//! `get_node`, and the gRPC handler then re-read each result from the store by
//! id. Each such call checks a reader connection out of the pool — and on a pool
//! miss *opens a new SQLite connection*. Individually these are cheap, but they
//! are all work that grows with the result count rather than with the corpus,
//! and they are the shape a per-result latency slope takes.
//!
//! These tests pin that shape rather than an absolute number. Wall-clock budgets
//! on a developer machine are noisy (a loaded local test gate runs these
//! alongside everything else), so the budgets below are deliberately generous —
//! they are sized to catch a per-result N+1 coming back, not to police
//! single-digit-percent drift.
