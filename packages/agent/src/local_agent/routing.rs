//! Two-stage skill-mediated routing (ADR-038).
//!
//! The model reaches capabilities through skills discovered by semantic

//! fallback. Retrieval itself is a deterministic system step the model does
//! not perform, which is where the candidate count is bounded and the trust
//! filter applies.
//!
//! ```text
//! Stage 1 (model):  emit EITHER a search query OR a clarification request
//!                   — a structural choice, not a confidence number
//! [system step]:    semantic retrieval over the skill registry → top-K,
//!                   score-gated. NOT a model tool call.
//! Stage 2 (model):  judge the candidates against the intent → pick one and
//!                   act, or clarify with the candidates as concrete options
//! ```
//!
//! ADR-038 rejects the single-turn pull (handing the model a `search_skills`
//! tool and letting it call retrieval itself), because that removes the
//! system's ability to bound K and enforce the trust boundary.

/// candidate whitelisting it ALSO happens to be the turn's overall best
/// match, not merely the best match among candidates that want that

/// both tools (it unions every cleared candidate's whitelist, uncapped by

/// tool's candidate is not the turn's single highest scorer, even though
/// that candidate is in no sense a distractor. That turn's lower-priority
/// tool falls back to the pre-existing bare-object-plus-prose shape — not a
/// regression relative to today's production (every write tool is on that
/// shape today), just a missed improvement for that turn. Nothing in the

/// well likely needs the same per-skill retrieval scoping core#2148 tracks.
