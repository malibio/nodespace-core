//! One-time routing-reliability probe for served (OpenAI-compatible) models.
//!
//! `tests/live_openai_compat_routing.rs` established, against a local Ollama,
//! that Stage-2 candidate injection is safe on most served models but not
//! all: it is a **per-model property**, not a native-vs-served split — the
//! locked native model and most measured served models route cleanly, while
//! one measured model (`mistral:7b`) loses tool-calling outright as soon as
//! any candidate block is present, independent of the block's content.
//!
//! ADR-038 names this as the load-bearing open question the routing design carried;
//! this probe is Option C from the decision that closed it: run one synthetic
//! routed turn per model load, cache the verdict, and skip Stage-2 injection
//! for a model that fails it — rather than paying a retry on every ambiguous
//! turn (Option B) or leaving every served model exposed until a user
//! notices (Option A).
//!
//! The probe is deliberately narrower than the live matrix: it runs exactly
//! the `routed_names` arm (a candidate block stripped to a bare skill name,
//! nothing else) because that arm is the strict subset of what `routed_full`
//! injects, and the matrix found the failure content-independent — a model
//! that survives the smaller block is not guaranteed to survive a larger one,
//! but a model that fails the smaller one will also fail the larger one, so
//! testing the minimal block is the conservative direction to probe in
//! without doubling the cost of every model load.
//!
//! It does, however, run the same Stage-1 pre-generation the matrix's routed
//! arms pay, matching the shape of request `agent_loop::run_turn` actually
//! sends — see [`probe_routing_ok`]'s doc comment.
