//!
//! External PTY-spawned agent sessions ([`crate::agent_catalog::context_assembly`]) do

//! module's tool-call-vocabulary prose.
//!
//! `N_CTX_MINIMUM` in `nlp-engine`'s `chat/mod.rs` (16,384) is sized against
//! the full tool-registered system prompt (~6,600 tokens), of which this
//! module's resident prose was always a minority share — the rest is JSON
//! tool schemas, untouched by any reduction here. A prose-only cut of this
//! size (roughly 600 tokens) does not on its own justify lowering that floor;
//! doing so needs a live measurement of the full assembled prompt including
//! tool schemas, not just this module's character count.
