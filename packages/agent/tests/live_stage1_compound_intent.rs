//! Live check for #1909: does Stage 1 (ADR-038) have a correct move for a
//! compound, unambiguous request — one message carrying two or more distinct
//! intents, none of which is unclear on its own?
//!
//! `routing.rs` offers exactly two Stage-1 tools: `route_query` (one
//! capability, one search string) and `route_clarify` (the request is too
//! ambiguous to describe). Neither has an obviously correct answer for "log
//! this expense and remind me to follow up Friday" — nothing is ambiguous
//! about either half, there are just two of them. This is a structural gap
//! identified by reading the code, not yet a measured defect; this test is
//! the live measurement #1909 asks for before proposing a fix.
//!
//! Fires production's exact Stage-1 request — `STAGE1_SYSTEM_PROMPT`,
//! `stage1_tool_definitions()`, temperature 0.1, `STAGE1_MAX_TOKENS` — against
//! the **locked native model, loaded in-process** (ADR-056: Gemma 4 E4B via
//! llama.cpp), for a wider set of compound-but-unambiguous prompts than the
//! first pass (#1909's PR #1916 shipped 5; this widens to cover varied
//! phrasing, 3-intent requests, and mutating/read-only combinations, per the
//! issue's own follow-up criterion — n=5 confirmed the structural gap exists
//! but could not size how often the model degrades a merged query). Records
//! the raw tool call plus the parsed `RouteDecision`, and tallies a
//! degradation rate across the run. No retrieval, no Stage 2: this isolates
//! Stage 1's own choice, which is what the issue is about.
//!
//! Deliberately native, not OpenAI-compatible/HTTP — `routing_latency.rs`
//! documents why a served stand-in (even a served copy of the same weights)
//! measures a different stack and does not describe what ships. This file
//! reuses that module's `resolve_backend` pattern so the two probes cannot
//! drift on how the locked model is loaded.
//!
//! Ignored by default — loads a ~9.6GB GGUF and runs many live generations,
//! too slow for the default `test:all` run. Skips gracefully (rather than
//! failing) when the locked model is not downloaded. Run explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test live_stage1_compound_intent -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **A single run is still not decision-grade** (see #1862's standing lesson
//! on single-run matrix numbers). This test reports a rate for one run; if
//! the rate matters for `route_multi`'s design, repeat the run and compare
//! before treating any single number as ground truth.
