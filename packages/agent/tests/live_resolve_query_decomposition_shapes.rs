//! Measurement harness for the question #2185 asks first: does
//! `resolve_query`'s internal decomposition sub-call actually emit malformed
//! filter shapes?
//!
//! The concern is real in structure. The four argument repairs
//! (`repair_over_quoted_keys`, `repair_leaked_special_token_keys`,
//! `repair_spliced_object_values`, `repair_scalar_in_operator_values`) run at
//! the agent loop's tool-call parse boundary. `exec_resolve_query` makes a
//! *nested* inference call and deserializes its output locally, so none of
//! them cover it. Whether that gap matters is an empirical question about what
//! this particular prompt, on this particular model, actually produces — and
//! #2182's lesson was precisely that the assumed malformation and the measured
//! one differed. So this measures before anything is repaired.
//!
//! What it does NOT do: assert a pass/fail bar on model behavior. It drives
//! the real `exec_resolve_query` over a corpus of phrasings, captures every
//! decomposition's *raw* text via the existing `NODESPACE_PROMPT_DUMP` hook
//! (`nlp-engine`'s `chat/prompt_dump.rs` names `resolve_query` as a covered
//! caller, so this needs no new production instrumentation), classifies each
//! emitted filter object against the shapes the repairs exist for, and prints
//! a tally. The human reads the tally and decides.
//!
//! Measuring through the real tool — rather than re-deriving the decomposition
//! prompt here — is deliberate. A hand-rebuilt prompt is a different arm from
//! the one production runs, and an arm that does not reach its own question
//! looks like a clean result. The prompt under test is built exactly once, in
//! `exec_resolve_query`, and this drives that.
//!
//! Run:
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test live_resolve_query_decomposition_shapes \
//!   -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
