//! Live check that `routing_probe::probe_routing_ok` agrees with the full
//! four-arm matrix (`live_openai_compat_routing.rs`) on a real server.
//!
//! The matrix is the source of truth for what "safe" and "suppressed" mean;
//! this test exists only to confirm the production probe function — the one
//! `local_agent_service.rs` actually calls on model load — reaches the same
//! verdict the matrix's `routed_names` arm did, against a live model rather
//! than the unit-level string comparison in
//! `live_openai_compat_routing.rs`'s `the_probes_block_matches_the_routed_names_arm`.
//!
//! Ignored by default — it needs a real server. Run explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test live_routing_probe -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **A degraded Ollama can fail both tests without either being wrong.**
//! Sustained heavy use (the four-arm matrix run repeatedly, back to back, for
//! an extended session) was observed to push a served model into returning
//! `{"created":-62135596800,"model":"","choices":[{"message":{"role":"",
//! "content":""}}]}` — HTTP 200, but a zeroed, garbage response — for *every*
//! request to that model, including a bare "say hello" with no tools and no
//! candidate block at all. That is a server/runtime fault, not a suppression
//! finding, and it will make this test fail (empty tool calls look identical
//! to a real suppression from the outside). Before treating a failure here as
//! a probe or production regression: `curl` the endpoint directly with a
//! trivial prompt for the model in question and check for exactly this
//! shape of degenerate response; if you see it, restart the server rather
//! than debugging this test's code.
