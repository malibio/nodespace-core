//! Golden-prompt harness for Stage-1 routing (ADR-038) — step 1 of the
//! deterministic prompt-assembly snapshot-test deliverable tracked on #1917.
//!
//! This is deliberately the SMALLEST possible call: build the exact
//! `STAGE1_SYSTEM_PROMPT` + `stage1_tool_definitions()` request
//! `agent_loop.rs`'s `route` function sends, call `LlamaChatInferenceEngine`
//! directly (in-process, no daemon, no chat-node lifecycle, no DB), and parse
//! the resulting tool call. No retrieval, no Stage 2, no tool execution.
//!
//! Purpose: separate "does this exact prompt text get the right tool call"
//! (answerable here, in seconds, no daemon restart or DB purge) from "does the
//! real pipeline assemble that exact prompt from real inputs" (a distinct,
//! deterministic, zero-model-call question — the snapshot tests this golden
//! set feeds, not yet written). The full live-model matrix (`bun run
//! eval:agent`) stays reserved for the end-to-end gate before merging a change
//! to shared surface, per this session's own rule 3 — not for iterating on
//! individual hypotheses, which is what made every prior checkpoint expensive.
//!
//! Ignored by default — loads a 5GB GGUF and needs the model on disk at the
//! standard NodeSpace catalog path. Run explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test live_stage1_golden_prompts -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
