//! Live routing-reliability matrix for the OpenAI-compatible path.
//!
//! [ADR-056](../../../../nodespace-docs/decisions/056-gemma-4-e4b-locked-native-model.md)
//! locks only the *native* in-process GGUF path to one model. The
//! OpenAI-compatible path stays open to any user-configured server by design,
//! which means ADR-038's two-stage routing runs against models nobody has
//! characterised.
//!
//! `live_openai_compat_smoke.rs` guards that the transport works: discovery
//! reaches the endpoint and an *unrouted* turn produces a tool call. That test
//! cannot see the failure this one looks for, because the failure appears only
//! once Stage-2's candidate block is in the prompt — a block the smoke test
//! never injects.
//!
//! The four arms isolate which part of routing, if any, suppresses
//! tool-calling on a served model:
//!
//! | arm             | candidate block | what it isolates                    |
//! |-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
//! | `baseline`      | none            | can the model tool-call at all      |
//! | `stage1_only`   | none            | server-side statefulness (see below)|
//! | `routed_full`   | yes, full       | ADR-064 rule 4's predicted mechanism |
//! | `routed_names`  | yes, names only | whether *content* is the variable   |
//!
//! `routed_names` is the arm that carries the finding. If a model fires on
//! `routed_full` but not `routed_names` — or suppresses on both — the operative
//! variable is the block's *presence*, not how procedural its content is, which
//! is what ADR-064 rule 4 predicts and what was measured on the locked model.
//!
//! **`stage1_only` is expected to match `baseline` on this transport, and that
//! is not a defect.** On the native in-process path, Stage 1's cost is a
//! diverged KV-cache prefix — the overhead ADR-038 accepts and requires be
//! measured. Over HTTP there is no shared prefix: each request is independent,
//! so a discarded Stage-1 generation cannot reach the measured turn through any
//! mechanism this test controls, and the two prompts are identical (asserted in
//! `the_four_arms_produce_distinct_prompts`). The arm is kept because that
//! independence is an assumption about the *server*, not a guarantee: a server
//! that carried conversation state across requests, or rate-limited or evicted a
//! model between them, would show up here as `stage1_only` diverging from
//! `baseline` — and would invalidate the routed arms, which pay the same
//! Stage-1 cost. It is a guard on the harness, not a measurement of routing.
//!
//! Measured against a local Ollama:
//!
//! ```text
//! model        baseline  stage1_only  routed_full  routed_names
//! gemma4:e4b   fires     fires        fires        fires
//! mistral:7b   fires     fires        SUPPRESSED   SUPPRESSED
//! ```
//!
//! What this establishes, and only this:
//!
//! 1. The locked model routes cleanly on every arm — the shipped configuration
//!    is unaffected, which is the result that matters for what NodeSpace runs.
//! 2. On `mistral:7b` the block's *presence* suppresses tool-calling, not its
//!    content — `routed_names` carries a name and nothing else and still
//!    suppresses. ADR-064 rule 4's mechanism, measured on the locked model,
//!    does not explain this.
//!
//! What it does **not** establish is how far the failure generalises. One
//! served model exhibits it and none is yet confirmed clean, so neither "all
//! served models are at risk" nor "this is specific to `mistral:7b`" follows.
//! Settling that needs a broader matrix — of models NodeSpace would actually
//! run, not whatever a dev box happens to serve; see
//! [`EXCLUDED_MODEL_FRAGMENTS`].
//!
//! Ignored by default — it needs a real server. Run explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test live_openai_compat_routing -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
