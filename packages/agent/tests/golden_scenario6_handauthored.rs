//! Hand-authored golden prompt for agent-matrix scenario 6, built independent
//! of ANY NodeSpace prompt-assembly source (no `STAGE1_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, no
//! `skill_pipeline.rs`, no `agent_guidance.rs` constants). Every string below
//! is authored fresh in this file.
//!
//! Methodology per the standing instruction on #1917: assemble a sequence of
//! literal prompt strings, validate directly against llama.cpp with zero
//! NodeSpace plumbing involved, until a version is found that reliably gets
//! the correct tool call. THAT becomes the target the real assembly pipeline
//! is engineered toward — not the other way around.
//!
//! Prior finding this experiment is built on (#1922, subagent investigation):
//! the model resolves "the 2400 one" -> resolve_query correctly with NO prior
//! history, 3/3. It refuses and asks for a literal node id the moment ANY
//! prior turn is present, 3/3, across 5 independent 3-rep trials on 4
//! different prompt channels (guidance reorder, injected write-record facts,
//! tool-description carve-outs, history composition). The scenario's real
//! conversation history is ~8,322 tokens of mostly-boilerplate wrapped around
//! a 10-word request -- consistent with this project's own resident-prompt
//! dilution finding (10,493 chars scored 50% vs 445 chars at 73% on cases
//! targeting the SAME prompt's own rules).
//!
//! This experiment's question: is the defect "any history at all" (unfixable
//! by prompt engineering, a real capability boundary) or "history above some
//! size/shape" (fixable by compacting what's carried forward)? Tests a
//! COMPACT hand-written summary of the same facts scenario 6's real 3-turn
//! history carries, instead of the full turn-by-turn reconstruction.
//!
//! Ignored by default — loads the 5GB locked native GGUF. Run explicitly:
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test golden_scenario6_handauthored -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
