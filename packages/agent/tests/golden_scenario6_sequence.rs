//! Golden-prompt SEQUENCE for agent-matrix scenario 6, built turn by turn.
//!
//! Per the corrected methodology (course-corrected mid-session on #1917):
//! `golden_scenario6_handauthored.rs` validated only the FINAL turn in
//! isolation, then plumbing work was started against that single data point.
//! That was premature — one confirmed turn is not a validated golden SET.
//! This file builds out the full 3-turn sequence scenario 6 actually
//! exercises, each turn hand-authored and validated independently against
//! bare llama.cpp before any NodeSpace assembly code is asked to reproduce
//! it. No production prompt-assembly source is reused here (no
//! `skill_pipeline.rs`, no `agent_guidance.rs`, no `STAGE1_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) —
//! every string is authored fresh, same discipline as
//! `golden_scenario6_handauthored.rs`.
//!
//! The three turns, matching agent-matrix scenarios 3/4/6 exactly:
//!   Turn 1 (matrix scenario 3): "I want to keep a record of the equipment
//!     my team checks out, whether it's been returned, and what each item
//!     costs to replace" -> should call create_schema, exactly once, with a
//!     replacement_cost field (and ideally a status field, since matrix
//!     scenario 6 later needs "returned" to be a settable property).
//!   Turn 2 (matrix scenario 4): "Log a laser cutter checked out on the
//!     12th, replacement cost 2400" -> should call create_node against the
//!     schema turn 1 created, persisting at least the replacement_cost.
//!   Turn 3 (matrix scenario 6): "The 2400 one came back — set it to
//!     returned" -> should call resolve_query then update_node (already
//!     partially validated in golden_scenario6_handauthored.rs, for the
//!     TERSE-history case only — this file re-validates it as part of a
//!     real sequence where turn 3's history is the ACTUAL output of turns 1
//!     and 2, not a hand-picked stand-in).
//!
//! Ignored by default — loads the 5GB locked native GGUF. Run explicitly:
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nodespace-agent --test golden_scenario6_sequence -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
