 * YAML frontmatter prepended to `SKILL.md` at install time.
 *
 * Shared by every target, not Claude-Code-specific. Under the Agent Skills
 * standard a skill is discovered by its frontmatter `name` + `description`, and
 * a folder without them is not a valid skill anywhere — so the three non-Claude
 * targets were previously installing a spec-invalid skill.
 *
 * Only fields the standard defines appear here (`name`, `description`,
 * `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`). Claude Code accepts
 * additional keys such as `argument-hint` and `user-invocable`, but other
 * distribution paths hard-error on keys they don't recognize, so harness-specific
 * fields must not go in the shared block.
 *
 * `name` must match the parent directory the skill installs into
 * (`skills/nodespace/` → `name: nodespace`).
 *
 * The `description` is the entire discovery surface: under progressive
 * disclosure an agent loads only `name` + `description` at startup and reads the
 * body *after* deciding the skill is relevant. So its job is to match how a user
 * actually phrases the request — which is why it is hand-tuned and deliberately
 * excluded from generation. There is no upstream source to render it from, and
 * generating it would produce worse text than tuning it.
 *
 * It leads with what NodeSpace is rather than with personal-memory phrasing
 * ("remember this for later"), because the product's own framing is context
 * infrastructure for AI-native development: the repository holds *what* was
 * built, NodeSpace holds *why* it was built and how it should be built. An agent
 * told that needs far less separate instruction to check NodeSpace before
 * writing a spec or an ADR.
 *
 * Max 1024 characters per the spec.
