# NodeSpace Skill

NodeSpace is context infrastructure for AI-native development — a local-first knowledge graph running on this machine.

**Repositories contain what was built. NodeSpace contains why it was built, how it should be built, and what agents need to know to build it correctly.** Specs, architecture decisions, ADRs, designs, plans, standards, tasks, and findings live here, not scattered across chat logs and stale docs. Code is the artifact; this is the context behind it.

It persists across sessions — what you save today is searchable tomorrow, and your context window does not survive the turn.

**So: read from NodeSpace before you write code or documents, and write back to it when you decide something.** If you're about to author a spec, an ADR, a design, or a plan — or you need the reasoning and constraints behind existing code — check here first. Whatever the repository cannot tell you about *why*, this can.

## How NodeSpace Thinks (Mental Model)

**Everything is a node.** A node has a type, markdown content, and optional typed properties. Node types are schema-defined: `text`, `task`, and `date` are built-ins; custom types come from user-defined schemas (`nodespace schema list` shows what's registered).

**Built-in node types:**
- `text` — freeform notes, documents, findings, summaries
- `task` — structured to-do items; carry `status` (`open`/`in_progress`/`done`/`cancelled`), `due_date` (YYYY-MM-DD), and `priority` (`low`/`medium`/`high`)
- `date` — daily container nodes (e.g. "2026-05-30"); each day has one. Attach time-sensitive findings under the relevant date node so they're retrievable by day.

**Hierarchy is first-class edges, not nesting.** A node has one parent edge. Children are ordered via fractional ordering — siblings have a stable position without gap-numbering. Moving or reordering a node is an edge operation (change the parent or sibling position), not a recreate-and-delete.

**Relationships are distinct from hierarchy and mentions.** A relationship is a named, schema-defined edge between two nodes (e.g. `billed_to`, `has_task`) — different from the one parent edge and from inline `mention` links captured from markdown content. Relationships must be defined on a schema (via `nodespace schema create`/`nodespace schema update`) before they can be used; `nodespace relationship create` on a node whose schema has no matching relationship name fails.

**Content is markdown.** Store prose, code blocks, lists — whatever fits the note. The export commands render it back as clean markdown.

## When to Use NodeSpace (Session Judgment)

Use NodeSpace as a working memory across sessions:

1. **Search at session start** — run the preflight, then search for prior context before you begin. (`nodespace search "topic"`)
2. **Save as you go** — save discoveries, decisions, and summaries during the session. Don't wait until the end.
3. **It persists across sessions** — your context window does not. Anything worth remembering next time should be stored.

Date nodes make temporal retrieval reliable: if a finding is time-bound, attach it under today's date node so future searches can scope by day.

## Shared Workspaces (Multi-User)

A NodeSpace collection can be **synced and shared** with a teammate through NodeSpace Pro: the daemon is launched already bound to it, so another engineer — or their agent — reads and writes the same graph. It is opt-in, private to its members, and syncs only once each engineer has signed in and enabled sync. In a shared workspace:

**Everything you save is visible, and you are not the only writer.** You don't pick the shared collection per write — nodes you create sync into it automatically. Keep private scratch in a separate database (`nodespace database create`/`--database`). A node here may have been created or last edited by your teammate, so don't assume it is yours or stable across your session, and search at session start to pull what they already saved. Don't move sensitive or unrelated notes in without intent.

**Attribute what you save, and prefer additive writes.** Put provenance in the content — who wrote it and when — since a human-readable marker is easier to scan than the per-node creator NodeSpace records. Add a new node rather than rewriting one your teammate authored; when you must update a shared node, pass the `version` you read via `nodespace node batch-update`, so a concurrent edit surfaces as an OCC conflict instead of silently overwriting. (`node update` without a version bypasses that check.)

**Recall is eventually consistent, and semantic search lags further.** A teammate's write appears after sync latency. For immediate cross-engineer recall use structured queries — `nodespace query`, or `nodespace node query --content-contains "..."` — which see a peer's node as soon as it syncs. Semantic `nodespace search` works only after your machine has embedded it: embeddings are generated locally, not synced, so fall back to `nodespace query` for a recent teammate note.

**Don't file shared memory under date nodes.** Attaching findings under `--parent "YYYY-MM-DD"` does **not** round-trip through sync yet — date-container nodes stay local. Save findings as regular nodes (optionally under a shared project or collection node) or your teammate won't see them.

## Preflight Check

**Before starting any multi-step NodeSpace operation**, work out which of three capability branches you're on, then follow that branch. Check capability first, before running anything — the branches below differ in how (or whether) you can run a `nodespace` command at all, so branching on a command's output only works once you already know you have a way to run commands.

**This is a soft inference, not an API call.** There is no "do I have Bash?" check to run — decide from the tools you were actually given this turn:

1. **A Bash/shell tool is available** → "Branch 1: Shell available" below.
2. **No Bash, but a `nodespace` tool is available** (its schema takes one `args: string` parameter — the MCP passthrough) → "Branch 2: No shell, `nodespace` MCP tool available" below.
3. **Neither** → "Branch 3: Neither shell nor MCP tool available" below.

A wrong guess should degrade gracefully, not dead-end: if Branch 1's commands come back as though there's no shell at all, or the `nodespace` tool you expected never appears in your tool list, fall through to the next branch rather than repeating the same failed approach.

**Consent discipline is identical on every branch.** Never run the installer, start the daemon, or delete a node or type without the user's explicit confirmation — the MCP passthrough is not an exception just because it's a tool call instead of a shell line; see "Delete a node" below, which applies unchanged regardless of which branch dispatched it.

### Branch 1: Shell available

Run these two commands to confirm the tooling is present and healthy:

```bash
nodespace --version
nodespace diagnostics
```

Run this preflight once per session or task, not before every individual command.

#### Failure recovery

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `command not found: nodespace` | CLI not installed or not on `$PATH` | Tell the user NodeSpace CLI is not installed and propose installing it — never run the installer without their explicit confirmation. If they confirm, run `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://nodespace.ai/install.sh)" -- --no-gui` (installs the CLI only, non-interactively — the same script the one-line install and `brew install --cask nodespaceai/nodespace/nodespace` both use). Then retry the original command. If it still fails because this shell session hasn't picked up the updated `$PATH`, tell the user to open a new terminal and try again. If they decline the install, stop. |
| `Could not connect to nodespaced` | Daemon not running | Surface the CLI's own message to the user: start the daemon with `nodespaced`. Do not retry automatically — wait for confirmation. |
| `diagnostics` shows entries in `errors` | Database issues | Report the specific error messages to the user before continuing. |

### Branch 2: No shell, `nodespace` MCP tool available

There's no shell, but a `nodespace` tool is on your tool list: a passthrough with one `args` parameter — the exact argument list that would follow `nodespace` on a shell line. Every command in this document works verbatim through it, with no separate command set to learn: what Branch 1 runs as `nodespace search "auth tokens"` on a shell line, this branch calls the tool with `args: "search \"auth tokens\""`; `nodespace node get <id>` becomes `args: "node get <id>"`; and so on for every example elsewhere in this file, including "Delete a node" below.

Run the same preflight by calling the tool twice:

```
args: "--version"
args: "diagnostics"
```

The tool's result text carries the underlying CLI's own output, so read it the way you'd read a shell command's output — but you cannot self-heal by running an installer or starting a daemon; you can only tell the user what's wrong.

#### Failure recovery

| Symptom (in the tool result) | Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `Failed to run the nodespace CLI at ...` | The CLI binary backing this passthrough is missing or broken | Tell the user NodeSpace needs to be reinstalled — point at the desktop app or `brew install --cask nodespaceai/nodespace/nodespace`. You cannot install it yourself from here; do not propose a command to run. |
| `Could not connect to nodespaced` | Daemon not running | Tell the user to start it with `nodespaced` on the machine hosting this connector — same fix as Branch 1, but you cannot run it yourself. Do not retry automatically. |
| `diagnostics` call (`args: "diagnostics"`) shows entries in `errors` | Database issues | Report the specific error messages to the user before continuing — same as Branch 1. |
| `did not complete within 120s` | The dispatched command streams or blocks (e.g. `session launch`/`session attach`) — this passthrough kills and reports it as a timeout rather than staying open | Do not retry it through this tool. Tell the user this NodeSpace command needs an interactive session and isn't supported through this connector; point them at a shell-capable surface (Branch 1: Claude Code, or Claude Desktop's Code tab) for it. |

### Branch 3: Neither shell nor MCP tool available

NodeSpace is not reachable from this surface. There is no command to run and nothing to propose running — do not attempt a `nodespace` invocation, and do not fabricate or guess at a result. Tell the user plainly that NodeSpace can't be reached from here, and point them at a surface that can: the NodeSpace desktop app, or a shell- or MCP-capable agent harness (e.g. Claude Code, or Claude Desktop's Code tab). Installing a connector is a step the user takes in their own client, not something you can do on their behalf.

## Prerequisites

NodeSpace daemon must be running. The `nodespace` CLI communicates with `nodespaced` over a Unix socket. If the daemon is not running, CLI commands will fail with a connection error.

Start the daemon: `nodespaced` (or it starts automatically on login if installed via DMG).

## Tool Decision Guide

Use this to pick the right command for the task at hand.

### Finding things

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Find nodes by keywords or meaning | `nodespace search "<query>"` |
| List all nodes of a type | `nodespace search "" --type <type>` |
| Filter by property values (status, due_date, priority, etc.) | `nodespace query --type <type> --filters '<json>'` |
| Filter with comparison operators (gt, lt, gte, lte, in) | `nodespace query --type <type> --filters '<json>'` |
| Exact substring match on content or title | `nodespace node query --content-contains "..."` / `--title-contains "..."` |
| Get a specific node by ID | `nodespace node get <id>` |

**`nodespace node query` is for exact substring/type matching only** (`--content-contains`, `--title-contains`, `--mentioned-by`, `--type`). It has no property-filter flags.

**`nodespace query` is the command for structured property queries** — status, due_date, priority, or any comparison operator. Examples:
- "find all my open tasks" → `nodespace query --type task --filters '[{"type":"property","operator":"equals","property":"status","value":"open"}]'`
- "tasks due tomorrow" → `nodespace query --type task --filters '[{"type":"property","operator":"equals","property":"due_date","value":"<YYYY-MM-DD>"}]' --sorting '[{"field":"due_date","direction":"asc"}]'`
- "tasks due this week" → `nodespace query --type task --filters '[{"type":"property","operator":"gte","property":"due_date","value":"<week start>"},{"type":"property","operator":"lte","property":"due_date","value":"<week end>"}]'`
- "high priority tasks" → `nodespace query --type task --filters '[{"type":"property","operator":"equals","property":"priority","value":"high"}]'`

Date format for all date properties: **YYYY-MM-DD**. Available operators: `equals`, `contains`, `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte`, `in`, `exists`. Filter types: `property`, `content`, `relationship`, `metadata`.

**`nodespace search` is semantic** (embedding-based similarity), ranked by relevance. Pass `--type` to narrow to one or more node types, `--limit` to cap results (default 20). A bare result is just the hit's own content — an imported doc's root is its heading — add `--include-content` (top 5) to read it; skip it for an existence check. It does not currently expose graph-boost, cross-collection exclusion, or edge-inclusion — for those, fall back to `nodespace query` plus a follow-up `nodespace relationship get` if you need connected nodes.

**Multiple topics:** run `nodespace search` once per topic rather than one broad search plus per-result fetches.

## CLI Reference

The complete command reference — every command, flag, argument shape, and output
format, with worked examples — is in **`references/cli.md`**. Read that file when
you need exact syntax.

All commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output.

**Selecting a database.** A single daemon can serve several local databases. Data
commands accept a global `--database <name|id>` flag; `NODESPACE_DATABASE` sets
the same target when the flag is absent. Without either, requests go to the
daemon's default database.

```bash
nodespace --database work node create --type text --content "work note"
NODESPACE_DATABASE=work nodespace search "meeting notes"
```

**The schemas on this machine are live data — never assume them.** Node types are
user-defined and differ per database, so read them at the moment you need them
rather than relying on anything written here:

```bash
nodespace schema list --json          # what types exist right now
nodespace schema get <type> --json    # a type's exact fields before writing one
```

## Common Agent Tasks

### Save a note for later

```bash
nodespace node create --type text --content "Key insight: the auth token expires after 1 hour"
```

### Search for previously stored context

```bash
nodespace search "authentication token refresh"
```

### Create a task

```bash
nodespace node create --type task --content "Implement rate limiting on the API gateway"
```

### Change a task's status

```bash
nodespace node set-status <task-id> done
```

### Organize under a parent

```bash
# Create a parent project node
nodespace node create --type text --content "Project: API Redesign"
# → returns {"id": "abc123", ...}

# Add sub-notes under it
nodespace node create --type text --content "Decision: use REST not GraphQL" --parent abc123
```

### Attach a finding to today's date node

Date node IDs are the date string itself (`"2026-05-30"`). Pass the date string directly as `--parent` — the daemon auto-creates the date node if it doesn't exist yet.

```bash
# Attach a finding under today — date node is created automatically if absent
nodespace node create --type text --content "Discovered: rate limiter uses fixed windows" --parent "2026-05-30"

# To retrieve an existing date node directly
nodespace node get "2026-05-30"
```

### Define a new entity type, then create an instance

```bash
# 1. Create the schema (one schema per request; `references/cli.md` has the full field/enum shape)
nodespace schema create --params '{"name":"Ticket","fields":[{"name":"status","type":"text"},{"name":"assignee","type":"text"}]}'

# 2. Create an instance
nodespace node create --type ticket --content "Fix flaky retry test" --parent <parent-id>
nodespace node update <the-new-id> --property assignee=dana --property status=in_dev
```

### Link two nodes with a typed relationship

```bash
# Relationship must already be defined on the source's schema (e.g. Ticket.belongs_to_sprint)
nodespace relationship create --from <ticket-id> --type belongs_to_sprint --to <sprint-id>
```

### Organize a node into a collection

Collections are how NodeSpace tags and groups things — a flat label and a nested `:`-delimited path (`docs:rust`) are one mechanism at two depths, the same syntax `import` and `search` take. Crucially, **collection membership is an argument to the create call**, not a follow-up write: pass `--collection` and every missing segment is created for you. Never look a collection up first or ask the user to pre-create one.

```bash
# One call: creates the node, creates `docs` and `rust`, files the node under `rust`
nodespace node create --type text --content "Pin tokio to 1.40" --collection docs:rust

# Repeatable, and it works on an existing node too
nodespace node create --type text --content "Retry budget" --collection docs:rust --collection decisions
nodespace node update <node-id> --collection docs:rust
```

A collection costs the same one flag as a single `tags` array element, so prefer it for any durable grouping: don't add a `tags`/`categories`/`topics`/`labels` field to a schema for something collections already model. Unlike an array value, a collection shows in the UI, is renamed once not per member, nests, and needs no schema change to join — `member_of` is structural, legal between any two nodes undeclared.

### Delete a node, or a whole node type

Deletion is permanent and takes the node's children with it. Resolve the node first and confirm with the user before deleting anything you did not just create — a wrong id here is not recoverable.

```bash
nodespace node query --content-contains "draft spec"   # resolve the id first
nodespace node delete <node-id>
```

If the user wants something out of the way rather than gone, prefer moving it (re-parent it, or drop it from a collection) over deleting it.

**A node type can be deleted too** — `nodespace schema delete <type>`, once `schema update` has cleared any relationship declarations pointing at or from it. Asked to remove, drop or clean up a type, including a throwaway one you just created, reach for this; never call it unsupported or strip a schema to an empty shell instead. Sequence in `references/cli.md`.

### Bulk import from markdown

```bash
nodespace import file ./notes.md
nodespace import dir ./docs --auto-collection-routing
```

Top-level headings become root nodes, sub-headings become children. Report the number of nodes created; don't follow up with search calls to verify.

### Export a document for AI context

```bash
# Export with OCC tokens so AI can update individual nodes
nodespace node export <doc-id> --json | jq '.markdown'

# Clean export for reading
nodespace node export <doc-id> --node-ids false
```

## Output Format

All `--json` commands output to stdout. Errors are written to stderr with a non-zero exit code.

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "node_type": "task",
  "content": "Buy groceries",
  "parent_id": null,
  "properties": {
    "status": "open",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "version": 1,
  "lifecycle_status": "active",
  "created_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "modified_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

`properties` is flat, keyed by the schema's field names: read `jq '.properties.status'`
directly. Those same bare names are what `--property` and `--filters` take. Empty is `{}`.
