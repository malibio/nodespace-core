//! tonic `LocalAgentService` implementation — node-as-message-queue architecture.
//!
//! The daemon watches for `NodeUpdated`/`NodeCreated` events on `ai-chat` nodes.
//! When the last message in `properties['ai-chat']['messages']` has `role: 'user'`
//! and `status == 'processing'`, it triggers an inference turn in-process.
//!
//! Streaming tokens are broadcast to any connected `SubscribeTokenStream` client
//! (the Tauri process), which translates them to Tauri events for the frontend.
//!
//! Session IPC (StartSession, SendMessage, EndSession) is removed. The node
//! is the sole source of truth for conversation state.
