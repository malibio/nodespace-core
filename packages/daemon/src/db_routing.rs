//! Request-scoped database routing middleware (ADR-053: "One Daemon, Multiple
//! Local Databases").
//!
//! [`DbManagerLayer`] injects the process-global [`DatabaseManager`] into every
//! request's extensions so the per-database gRPC handlers can resolve the
//! `x-ns-database-id` routing header and dispatch to the right database. The
//! layer is installed only by the community/core serve loops; the Pro daemon
//! (`nodespaced-pro`) does not install it, so its handlers find no manager in
//! the extensions and fall back to the default database — behavior identical to
//! before this stage.
//!
//! The layer is a thin synchronous injector: it only clones an `Arc` into the
//! request extensions. The (async) resolve-and-open work happens inside the
//! handlers, where errors turn naturally into `tonic::Status`.
