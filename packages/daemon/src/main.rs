//! `nodespaced` — background daemon that owns the SQLite database lock and serves
//! NodeSpace operations over gRPC on a Unix Domain Socket.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!   1. Initialize tracing.
//!   2. Install signal handlers (fail-fast — a daemon that can't observe
//!      shutdown signals is broken).
//!   3. Open `SqliteStore` (embedded SQLite/libsql) at the configured path.
//!   4. Build `NodeService` from `nodespace-core`.
//!   5. Bring up the system tray on the main thread and spawn the tonic
//!      `NodeService` handler on a worker tokio runtime.
//!   6. Tear down cleanly on `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`, or "Quit" from the tray.
//!
//! # Trust model (ADR-052)
//!
//! This daemon is single-user-local and has **no in-core authorization layer**
//! — no `user_id`, no actor concept, no per-request ACL. Every request that
//! reaches the gRPC services below is served with the daemon owner's full
//! authority over the entire knowledge graph. That is deliberate, not an
//! omission to be backfilled: for a single-user-local desktop app the **OS
//! socket/pipe permission is the entire authorization boundary**. Whoever can
//! open the socket gets the whole graph.
//!
//! On Unix, [`bind_uds_owner_only`] enforces that boundary as `0o600` with no
//! ambient-umask exposure window. There is currently no peer-credential check
//! (`SO_PEERCRED` / `LOCAL_PEERCRED`) backstopping the file permission — every
//! connection accepted by the listener is handed straight to the tonic
//! server. On Windows the Named Pipe below does **not** yet meet this trust
//! model: it is created with the default DACL and `first_pipe_instance(false)`,
//! so it is reachable by other local principals and squattable (tracked
//! separately; see ADR-052 for the full security review and remediation
//! plan). Do not assume a peer-identity check exists anywhere in this file.
