# NodeSpace

> **Faster context. Fewer tokens.**

AI coding assistants forget everything between sessions. NodeSpace gives them persistent, searchable access to your project knowledge — so you stop re-explaining your codebase every time you start a conversation.

> ⚠️ **Alpha Preview** — NodeSpace is in early development. Features may change and data formats are not yet stable.

## Why NodeSpace

Developers using AI assistants waste time copying files, re-explaining architecture, and watching context degrade mid-session. NodeSpace fixes this by sitting between your knowledge and your AI tools:

- **80% fewer roundtrips** — AI agents query your knowledge base via the NodeSpace skill instead of scanning files with grep/ripgrep
- **Runs entirely on your machine** — no cloud accounts, no API calls, no data leaving localhost
- **Works offline** — on planes, behind VPNs, anywhere

You write things down once. Every AI tool you use can find them instantly.
