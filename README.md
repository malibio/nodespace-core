- **Database**: LanceDB for both structured data and vector embeddings

### AI Integration
- **Model**: Gemma 3n-E4B-it 8B (4-6GB RAM, excellent capability/resource balance)
- **Format**: UQFF (Ultra-Quick File Format) for fast model loading
- **Acceleration**: Metal GPU support on macOS
- **Backends**: Configurable support for mistral.rs, Ollama, and Candle

### Development Features
- **Build System**: Cargo workspace with optimized compilation
- **Testing**: Real service integration testing (no mocks)
- **Plugin Development**: Build-time compilation with service injection
- **Cross-Platform**: Native performance on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.80+ with Cargo
- Node.js 20 LTS for frontend development
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for AI model
- macOS with Metal GPU support (optimal performance)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd nodespace-core

# Install dependencies
cargo build
npm install

# Download AI model (Gemma 3n-E4B-it 8B UQFF)
# Place in /Users/malibio/nodespace/models/gemma-3-4b-it-UQFF/

# Run in development mode
cargo run
```

### Configuration

NodeSpace supports multiple AI backends for development flexibility:

```rust
// Configuration options
AIBackend::MistralRS {
    model_path: "/path/to/gemma-3n-4b-it-UQFF"
}
AIBackend::Ollama {
    endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
}
AIBackend::Candle {
    model_config: CandleConfig::default()
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Building
```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Frontend development
npm run dev

# Run tests
cargo test
npm test
```

### Testing Philosophy
NodeSpace follows a "real services" testing approach:
- Integration tests use actual PostgreSQL, LanceDB, and AI models
- No mocking of external services
- Comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing
- Performance benchmarking with real data

### Plugin Development
NodeSpace uses "NodeType Extensions" for internal parallel development:
- Build-time compilation for optimal performance
- Service injection pattern for testability
- Shared interfaces for consistent behavior
- Examples and templates for rapid development

## Contributing

### Code Standards
- Rust code follows standard formatting (rustfmt)
- Comprehensive error handling with anyhow
- Async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- Strong typing and trait-based abstractions

### NodeType Development
When creating new node types:
1. Define traits for core functionality
2. Implement service injection patterns
3. Create comprehensive integration tests
4. Document AI integration points
5. Follow existing naming conventions

### Documentation
- Update architecture docs for significant changes
- Include examples in plugin development guide
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting
- Cross-reference related documentation
